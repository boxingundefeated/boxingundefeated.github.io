### [Body-Solid 100 lb. Kettlebell with Matte Black Finish](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-50-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-50-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a big fan of Body-Solid's Kettlebells ever since I started incorporating them into my workout routine. The KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells are a staple in my home gym, and they've been a game-changer for my strength training and overall fitness.

First off, the matte-black chip-resistant powder coat finish is a standout feature. It not only looks sleek and modern but also provides an excellent grip even when my hands are sweaty during intense workout sessions. Plus, the powder coat is incredibly durable and resists chipping, which keeps the kettlebells looking brand new for much longer than other brands I've tried.

Another highlight is the easy-to-read weight display on each kettlebell. Having the weight clearly marked makes it simple and quick to find the right size for my needs, whether I'm doing kettlebell swings or incorporating them into other exercises.

Finally, the machined bottoms on these kettlebells provide a stable, wobble-free base. This is super important for balance and safety, especially during exercises like kettlebell snatches and lunges.

However, one downside is that the range of weights available is somewhat limited. While they do offer kettlebells from 5 to 80 pounds, I wish there was an option for a 90 or 100-pound kettlebell to continue challenging myself as I progress in my fitness journey.

All in all, the Body-Solid KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells have been a fantastic addition to my home gym. They're durable, versatile, and offer a comfortable grip for a safe and effective workout experience.

### [Onnit Bigfoot 90lb Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been incorporating the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) into my workout routine, and I must say it's been a game-changer. The unique design of this kettlebell, featuring a detailed Sasquatch face, not only adds a fun twist to my exercise regimen but also inspires me to push harder and break through my fitness plateaus.

One aspect that really stands out about the Bigfoot kettlebell is its sturdiness. The solid cast iron construction makes it feel incredibly secure and reliable during even my most intense workout sessions. It's evident that Onnit took great care in crafting this piece, as evidenced by the even weight distribution and comfortable grip.

Another highlight of this product is its excellent durability. Despite using it multiple times a week for several weeks now, the paint hasn't chipped or worn off in any significant way – a testament to the high-quality materials and manufacturing process employed by Onnit.

However, one minor issue I've encountered with the Bigfoot kettlebell is the way its ears stick out. While this design choice certainly contributes to the product's eye-catching appearance, it can sometimes make certain exercises, like holding the bell by the ears during squats, feel slightly awkward or uncomfortable.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) to anyone looking to add a little excitement and motivation to their fitness routine. Its unique design, top-notch construction, and impressive durability make it an excellent addition to any home gym. Just be mindful of the ear placement if you plan on using it for specific exercises that require a comfortable grip.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this Balancefrom Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set, and I must say it's a game-changer! It's perfect for incorporating into my workout routine. I particularly like the variety of weights included in this set - 5lb, 10lb, and 15lb. This has given me the flexibility to gradually increase the intensity of my workouts, keeping things interesting and effective.

One feature that stands out is the wide grip design, which provides a comfortable and secure hold while performing various exercises. It has made my movements more fluid and controlled, and I've seen a significant improvement in my balance and muscular control. Plus, the vinyl coating on the kettlebells is a nice touch, adding durability and protecting my floors from any damage.

However, there have been a few hiccups. The labeling on the weights is not as secure as I'd like. Some stickers have peeled off or lost their adhesion over time, making it difficult to tell which weight I'm using at a glance. Additionally, the packaging was a bit lackluster, with no cushioning or support for the weights, making them vulnerable to damage during transit.

In conclusion, while the Balancefrom Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set has some minor flaws, the overall experience has been quite positive. [The variety of weights, combined with the comfortable grip and durable vinyl coating, makes this set a valuable addition to any home fitness routine.](https://best.serp.co/rubber-weight-sets/)

### [10 LB Vinyl Coated Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weights-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weights-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[As someone who enjoys working out at home, I recently decided to incorporate kettlebell exercises into my fitness routine.](https://best.serp.co/shop/kettlebell-weight/) After browsing through various options, I decided to give the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell Weights a try. The brightly-colored vinyl coating caught my eye, and the diverse weight options allowed me to find the right weight to match my fitness level.

From the moment I received the kettlebell, it was clear I had made the right choice. The quality of the cast iron was undeniable, and the vinyl coating not only added a pop of color to my workout space but also proved to be incredibly durable. As I began my workouts, I appreciated the wide handle that allowed me to comfortably grip the kettlebell with both hands, ensuring that I was able to maintain proper form and maximize the effectiveness of each exercise.

I was also pleasantly surprised by how quiet the kettlebell was during use. The vinyl coating significantly reduced noise and prevented damage to the flooring in my workout area. The weight options ranging from 5 to 50 pounds provided me with ample opportunity for progression in my workouts, and the stability of the flat bottom design allowed me to confidently switch hands during my reps.

In terms of storage, I found the vinyl coated kettlebell weights to be quite space-efficient. Their compact design made it easy for me to store them in a corner of my workout area without taking up too much space. Additionally, the clearly marked weights on each kettlebell made it convenient for me to track my progress and ensure that I was consistently challenging myself during my workouts.

There are a few minor drawbacks to the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Kettlebell Weights that I discovered during my testing. While the vinyl coating adds a great deal of durability and protection, it can be somewhat slippery when your hands become sweaty. Additionally, the kettlebell is quite heavy even in the lighter weight options, which may not be suitable for individuals with limited strength or mobility.

Overall, I am quite impressed with the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Kettlebell Weights. They have effectively enhanced my home workout routine, providing me with a variety of challenging exercises that help to improve my strength and overall fitness. The durability of the cast iron construction, along with the convenience and storage efficiency provided by the vinyl coating, make these kettlebells a valuable addition to any fitness enthusiast's collection.

### [Apex Adjustable Weight Set](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="apex-adjustable-kettlebell-apkb-5010" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/apex-adjustable-kettlebell-apkb-5010/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Apex, [Adjustable Kettlebell](https://best.serp.co/shop/adjustable-kettlebell/) to my home gym routine and I must say, it's a game-changer. This versatile piece of equipment is a complete weight set that's perfect for muscle building and weight lifting.

One thing I love about this kettlebell is its adjustability. The weight can be customized between 20 and 50 pounds by replacing the removable spacer disks with standard 2.5, 5, or 10-pound weights (sold separately). This feature makes it easy for me to challenge myself as my fitness level improves, without needing to buy multiple kettlebells.

The build quality of the Apex Kettlebell is impressive too. It's made from solid cast-iron and reinforced with a powder coating, making it incredibly durable. I've been using this kettlebell regularly for months now and there's no signs of wear or damage whatsoever.

The traditional u-bar handle is another standout feature. It provides optimal grip control, allowing me to perform large movements with ease and precision. This has been especially helpful during tough workouts when I need maximum control over the weight.

In terms of exercise versatility, the Apex Adjustable Kettlebell truly shines. Whether you're lifting, swinging, toning, or building muscle, this kettlebell delivers an effective workout. I've found it particularly useful for circuit training and bodybuilding routines.

However, one drawback is that the weighted [plates](https://best.serp.co/shop/plates/) are not included, which means you'll need to purchase them separately. Additionally, although the product description does not mention any required tools, some reviewers have noted that a locking mechanism could make assembling and disassembling the kettlebell easier.

Overall, the Apex, Adjustable Kettlebell has been a valuable addition to my home gym. Its adjustability, robust build quality, and versatile exercise options have made my workouts more challenging and enjoyable. [If you're looking for a high-quality kettlebell that offers flexibility and durability, this one is definitely worth considering.](https://best.serp.co/shop/onnit-kettlebells/)

### [Powder Coated 20 kg (44 lb) Kettlebell for Strength and Endurance Training](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

At first, I was skeptical about purchasing it due to the weight, but its powder-coated surface provides a textured grip that makes even the toughest workout sessions manageable.

One of my favorite features is the color weight indicators on the handle, making it incredibly easy to identify each kettlebell in my collection. Its single cast construction offers unmatched durability, giving me peace of mind knowing that my investment will last for years to come.

However, there is a slight drawback. Due to its heavyweight, I sometimes find it challenging to perform certain exercises without additional support or assistance. Overall, I'm thrilled with this 20kg kettlebell, and it has become an integral part of my fitness journey.

### [Durable Cast Iron Kettlebell for Home Gym](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="marcy-hkb-045-hammertone-kettlebell-45-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/marcy-hkb-045-hammertone-kettlebell-45-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got myself a Marcy Hammertone Kettlebell 45lb for my home gym, and I have to say, it has been a game-changer. This solid piece of workout equipment is made from eco-friendly recyclable cast iron and comes with a durable Hammertone finish that not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also offers a non-slip grip.

What I love most about this kettlebell is its versatility - you can use it for a variety of exercises including swings, squats, and deadlifts. Plus, it's got a comfortable handle diameter of 1.5 inches, making it easy to hold onto even during the most intense routines.

### [24 kg High-Quality Polished Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

As a fitness enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for durable workout equipment that doesn't compromise on quality. That's why I decided to give the Shogun Sports Cast Iron Kettlebells a try.

The first thing that caught my attention was the smooth, polished surface. It's evident that these kettlebells have been meticulously designed to provide a comfortable grip without causing any strain or discomfort to your hands during intense workout sessions. This is further enhanced by the corrosion-resistant paint, which not only adds to the durability but also ensures a good grip even when your hands are sweaty.

Made from a single cast of iron, they're devoid of any seams, welds, or burrs that could potentially lead to weaker spots or potential injury. They're also marked with both pounds and kilograms, making them versatile for users across the globe.

However, despite its many merits, the size of the kettlebell might be a downside for beginners. At 24 kg / 53 lb, it might be too heavy for those just starting out with kettlebell training. But for seasoned fitness enthusiasts like myself, it's just the right weight to challenge and push my limits.

All in all, the Shogun Sports Cast Iron Kettlebell has been a reliable companion in my home gym, helping me effectively target and tone various muscle groups. Its sturdy construction and user-friendly design make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to upgrade their fitness routine.

### [70lb Body Solid Premium Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

I recently purchased a Body Solid 70lb Premium Kettlebell for my home gym, and I must say, it has quickly become a staple in my workout routine. The weight reference on the side is incredibly easy to read, which makes selecting the right amount of resistance for each exercise a breeze. Additionally, the chrome handles provide a comfortable grip that slides nicely in my hands.

One feature I particularly enjoy is the rubber coating, as it not only protects my equipment from scratches and dings but also helps reduce noise when setting down the kettlebell during intense workouts. Another perk is the larger handles on heavier kettlebells; they allow me to comfortably grip the weight with both hands, making certain exercises more accessible.

However, there's one minor con - the price point is relatively high compared to other kettlebells on the market. But considering its quality and durability, I believe it's worth the investment for those serious about incorporating kettlebell workouts into their fitness regimen.

### [Robust 72lb Kettlebell by Onnit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-gorilla-72lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-gorilla-72lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Well, I must say that this Onnit Primal Bell (Gorilla - 72lb) has definitely spiced up my workout routine! The moment I laid my eyes on this thing, I knew I had to give it a shot. And boy, was I right! This kettlebell has been my new workout buddy, adding a fun twist to my regular workouts.

Firstly, the design is just simply amazing. The gorilla face is not only eye-catching but also motivational (I mean, who wouldn't want to look like a strong gorilla? ). It's like a piece of performance art in my home gym. Plus, the enlarged handles really enhance my grip strength, making me feel like a true beast during my workouts.

However, I did experience a couple of minor setbacks with this primal bell. The chip-resistant coating, while strong, can be a tad difficult to clean after an intense workout session. Also, the length of the bell can make cleans a bit awkward, though it's perfect for snatches.

Despite these minor cons, I am absolutely loving this Onnit Primal Bell. It's a unique and fun addition to my home gym that not only looks great but also helps me get in shape and stay motivated.

### [Adjustable Matte Kettlebell with Multiple Weight Options](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="rep-fitness-adjustable-kettlebell-with-matte-powder-coating-quickly-select-from-multiple-kg-or-lb-we-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rep-fitness-adjustable-kettlebell-with-matte-powder-coating-quickly-select-from-multiple-kg-or-lb-we-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Rep Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell for a few months now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my home gym. The quick and easy weight adjustment feature is truly revolutionary; you can switch from one weight setting to another in seconds. This is a huge improvement over traditional kettlebells, which usually require you to have multiple weights on hand.

One of the standout features of this kettlebell is its ergonomic design. The competition shape is not only easier on my wrists and forearms but also maintains its shape no matter what weight is used. I appreciate the comfort and control it provides during advanced exercises like snatches and cleans.

Another aspect that deserves mention is the matte powder coating. Unlike glossy finishes found on some kettlebells, this one isn't slippery at all. Plus, the internal nylon thermoplastic weight retainers are incredibly rugged and secure each weight plate with fasteners. The rubber bottom is an added bonus, helping to protect my floor while I'm swinging away.

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the kettlebell is quite large, which might be an issue for smaller individuals like myself. The thick handle can make certain exercises (like cleans) uncomfortable, and I sometimes find myself struggling to grip it consistently. Additionally, the weights can make a bit of noise during swings, which can be distracting.

All things considered, the Rep Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell has been an excellent addition to my workout routine. Its innovative design, comfortable grip, and sturdy construction make it a top-notch choice for anyone looking to incorporate kettlebells into their fitness regimen.

### [Ethos Terracotta Soft Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

The sturdy construction of the Calia Soft Kettlebell is another standout feature that has impressed me. Its soft base ensures that I can work out at home without worrying about damaging my floors, while the overall durability of the product promises years of hassle-free use.

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a few minor drawbacks to the Calia Soft Kettlebell. For instance, the lack of a clear weight indication on the kettlebell itself can occasionally make it difficult to quickly identify the weight of the kettlebell I’m using without checking the label. Additionally, the kettlebell’s rounded edges can sometimes cause it to roll away from me during particularly intense workout sessions, which can be somewhat inconvenient.

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend the Calia Soft Kettlebell in Terracotta to anyone looking to add a versatile, well-crafted tool to their fitness routine. Its comfortable grip, sturdy construction, and neutral color make it perfect for both studio and home workouts. While there are a few minor drawbacks to consider, the benefits of this kettlebell far outweigh the negatives. Happy kettlebell swinging!

### [Lifeline 12kg Kettlebell for Unique Fitness Experience](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

The Lifeline Kettlebell is my go-to workout tool, especially during these pandemic days. I own the 12kg version and it's been a game-changer for my home gym. Its wide, flat machined base prevents any wobbling on the floor, ensuring stability during my intense swings and squats. I also appreciate the color-coded stripes on the handles which help me quickly identify different weight levels.

The kettlebell's design comfort is top-notch. Its wide and thick diameter handles allow for free-flowing movements without straining my wrists, even during long workout sessions. Plus, the consistent surface and durable powder-coat finish make it feel like a premium piece of equipment.

But it's not just about the looks; this kettlebell packs a serious fitness punch. Combining cardio burn with strength training and flexibility exercises, I've seen significant improvements in my overall fitness since incorporating it into my routine. And because of its off-centered weighting, I've noticed an increase in muscle activation and greater range of motion during workouts.

However, I do have a minor issue with the product - the color-coded stripes on the handles. While they serve their purpose, I feel like they might be unnecessary for someone who is familiar with kettlebells. But that's really a minor quibble in an otherwise excellent product.

In conclusion, the Lifeline Kettlebell is a well-made, comfortable to use, and versatile tool for anyone looking to upgrade their home workout gear. Its premium quality at an affordable price point makes it a worthy addition to any fitness enthusiast's collection.

### [Goruck Sand Kettlebell - 16 kg](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/monkey-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="goruck-sand-kettlebell-35lb-16kg-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/goruck-sand-kettlebell-35lb-16kg-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell, specifically the 35lb model. As a fitness enthusiast, I've always been curious about kettlebells, but never quite found one that appealed to my aesthetic sensibilities. This Sand Kettlebell, however, has completely turned my perspective around.

To start with, I was blown away by the quality of this product. The 1000D Cordura material is incredibly durable, and the double-pass stitching all around gives it a robustness that's hard to find in other kettlebells. The neoprene padding on the handle is an excellent touch - it provides a comfortable grip while also giving a certain level of softness that's quite appealing.

The handle is also incredibly versatile, allowing for a variety of grips depending on the exercise.

However, there are a few cons to this product too. The filler capacity wasn't quite what I expected, and I had to fill the kettlebell quite a bit to reach the desired weight. This led to a slightly less comfortable grip, though it's not a deal-breaker. Additionally, the flexible handles might not be ideal for some exercises such as goblet squats, though they still work well for most kettlebell movements.

All in all, the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell has been a fantastic addition to my home gym. Its high-quality build, adaptability, and comfortable grip make it stand out from other kettlebells on the market. While there are a few minor issues, these do not detract from the overall superior performance of this product. If you're looking for a durable, versatile kettlebell that offers custom weight loads and maximum endurance over daily use, the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell is definitely worth considering.
