### [Sustainable 40 oz Quencher H2.0 Tumbler](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="stanley-40-oz-quencher-h2-0-flowstate-tumbler-iris-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stanley-40-oz-quencher-h2-0-flowstate-tumbler-iris-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stanley 40 oz. Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler in Iris, and I have to say, it's truly been a game-changer for me. As someone who's always on-the-go, whether it's commuting to work, hitting the gym, or spending time outdoors, I need a reliable drinkware that can handle all my hydration needs. This tumbler has more than exceeded my expectations.

First and foremost, the construction of this tumbler is top-notch. Made from recycled 18/8 stainless steel, it not only looks great but also feels incredibly durable. I've been using it daily for the past few weeks, and there's not a single scratch or dent in sight.

One thing I absolutely love about this tumbler is its capacity. At 40 oz. , it holds enough liquid to keep me hydrated throughout the day. Plus, the advanced FlowState lid ensures that my beverages stay at the perfect temperature, whether it's [hot tea](https://best.serp.co/shop/hot-tea/)tea or ice-cold water.

The ergonomic handle is another standout feature. It's designed with comfort-grip inserts, making it super easy to carry around with me wherever I go. And speaking of convenience, the narrow base fits perfectly in my car cup holder, which means I can enjoy sipping on my favorite drink while driving.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The first is that the screw-on cap can be a bit difficult to twist off, especially when you're in a hurry and want to take a quick sip. Additionally, although the reusable straw included is a nice touch, I find myself preferring to use the opening on the FlowState lid.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Stanley 40 oz. Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler to anyone in search of a high-quality, reliable, and sustainable drinkware solution. It may be a bit on the pricy side, but believe me, it's worth every penny.

### [40oz Stainless Steel Wide Mouth Hydration Bottle with Flex Straw Lid](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="iron-flask-40oz-stainless-steel-wide-mouth-hydration-bottle-with-flex-straw-lid-dark-pine-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iron-flask-40oz-stainless-steel-wide-mouth-hydration-bottle-with-flex-straw-lid-dark-pine-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a Dark Pine Iron Flask Wide Mouth Hydration Bottle, and let me tell you, it's become my faithful companion on all my outdoor adventures. This 40oz bottle is the perfect size for a full day's hydration, and it's designed with sturdy stainless steel that not only keeps your drinks cold for hours but also ensures the bottle will last you a lifetime.

One of the standout features of this bottle is its flexibility in terms of lids. It comes with not one, but three different lids - a Flex Straw Lid, a Spout Lid, and a Flip Lid - so you can choose the one that suits your needs best. I particularly enjoy the convenience of the straw lid for a quick sip of water on a hot day.

However, not everything is perfect about this bottle. The straw might stick straight up instead of bending at a 90-degree angle, and sometimes it felt like I had to work a bit harder to get the liquid out. Additionally, the branding on the bottle might not appeal to everyone, including myself.

All in all, the Iron Flask Wide Mouth Hydration Bottle is a high-quality companion that will keep you hydrated on your daily escapades. Despite some minor drawbacks, I am sure that this bottle will continue to serve me well for many more adventures to come.

### [Sustainable Insulated 40 oz. Quencher Tumbler](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="stanley-40-oz-quencher-h2-0-flowstate-tumbler-pine-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stanley-40-oz-quencher-h2-0-flowstate-tumbler-pine-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hey there, fellow hydration seeker! As someone who's recently been using the Stanley 40 oz. Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler in Pine Green, let me share my experience with you.

First off, this tumbler is made from recycled stainless steel, which means it's not only nice to our planet but also super durable. Perfect for those accident-prone days (trust me, I've had my fair share! ).

One of my favorite features of this tumbler is its vacuum insulation. You know how some water bottles forget to keep your drink ice-cold? Not this one! Whether you're exploring the great outdoors or just enjoying a lazy afternoon on the porch, your beverage stays chilled for hours on end.

The Advanced FlowState lid deserves a special mention too. With three positions to choose from, including a straw opening, a drink opening, and a full-cover top, there's no spillage risk here. Plus, the ergonomic handle with comfort-grip inserts makes carrying this tumbler feel like a breeze.

There are a few downsides, though. The soft matte finish can scratch easily, so if you're planning on throwing this thing around, be prepared to see some battle scars. And while the narrow base fits most car cup holders, it might not fit in all stroller or [shopping cart](https://best.serp.co/shop/shopping-cart/) cup holders.

All in all, the Stanley 40 oz. Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler has been a trusty companion in my daily life. If you're looking for a durable and eco-friendly tumbler that keeps your drinks cold while offering convenience with its advanced lid and ergonomic handle, this could be your perfect match.

### [Insulated 40oz Water Bottle with Handle and Straw](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="simple-modern-water-bottle-with-straw-handle-and-chug-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-bottles-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-water-bottle-with-straw-handle-and-chug-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-bottles-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I absolutely adore my Simple Modern water bottle with straw, handle, and chug lid. I have had it for quite some time now, and it has become an essential part of my daily routine. It keeps my water ice-cold for hours on end, even when I'm out in the scorching sun! I've tried other water bottles before, but this one truly stands out.

The double-walled insulation provides excellent temperature control, ensuring my beverages remain at their ideal temperature for as long as possible. Plus, the fact that it's BPA-free gives me peace of mind knowing that my drink is completely safe. Oh, and did I mention how well it's made? The durable finish resists scratches and dents, ensuring that my bottle will last for years to come.

As for the negatives, there aren't many to speak of. Some users have reported issues with leakage or difficulty cleaning the straw, but I haven't experienced any of these problems myself. In fact, I find the straw incredibly easy to use and clean – no unpleasant aftertaste or residue here!

In conclusion, the Simple Modern water bottle with straw, handle, and chug lid is hands-down one of the best water bottles I've ever owned. Not only does it keep my drinks ice-cold, but it also looks great with its vibrant colors and stylish design. If you're in the market for a new water bottle, look no further than this fantastic product!

### [NFL New York Jets-Licensed Water Bottle with Straw Lid from Simple Modern](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="simple-modern-officially-licensed-nfl-new-york-jets-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-sta-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-officially-licensed-nfl-new-york-jets-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-sta-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the officially licensed NFL New York Jets Water Bottle with Straw Lid for my daily hydration needs. With its vacuum insulation, I've been able to keep my water cold for hours, making it perfect for long workouts or hot summer days. The straw lid is also a great addition, as it makes drinking water effortless and prevents any potential spills.

One of the standout features of this water bottle is its high-quality, rust-resistant stainless steel construction. It's not only durable and long-lasting, but it also gives the bottle a sleek and modern look. Additionally, the bottle's team spirit design adds a personalized touch and allows me to showcase my love for the New York Jets.

However, one aspect that didn't quite match my expectations was the bottle's suitability for hot or carbonated liquids. As mentioned in the instructions, these types of beverages can cause pressure build-up and result in leaks or spills. Another minor issue I encountered was the cleaning process, which requires hand washing for the bottle and top-rack dishwasher safe for the straw lid.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the Simple Modern NFL New York Jets Water Bottle. Its ability to keep my water cold for hours, along with its strong and durable build, make it a reliable companion for my daily activities. While it may not be perfect for hot or carbonated drinks, its performance with water is exceptional and worth considering for any NFL fan.

### [30-Hour Insulated Large Water Bottle with Straw and Lid](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img alt="hydrapeak-voyager-40oz-tumbler-with-handle-and-straw-apricot-crush-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hydrapeak-voyager-40oz-tumbler-with-handle-and-straw-apricot-crush-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I love it, Rating 5"

I recently got my hands on the Hydrapeak Voyager 40oz TumblerTumbler with Handle and Straw in Apricot Crush, and it's like my new best buddy on all my outings. I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it is, and the beautiful Apricot Crush color is a total head-turner. The handle is a game-changer, making it super easy to carry around without straining my fingers.

A standout feature for me is the insulation; my hot tea stays warm for a good 12 hours, and even my iced coffee maintains its chill for up to 30 hours. Plus, the tumbler's double-wall insulation prevents any condensation from forming on the outside, so no need to wipe it down constantly.

One concern I had was whether the lid would be leak-proof or not. But, much to my relief, it's spill-proof, which puts me at ease even when I'm tossing it in my bag with my belongings. The non-slip rubber base adds to its practicality with no sliding or scratching, and it looks just as good as its pricier counterparts.

However, one downside for me is that it doesn't fit perfectly in cup holders, which can be an inconvenience when I'm on the go, and it's definitely not a secret that it's not actually a [40 oz tumbler](https://best.serp.co/shop/40-oz-tumbler/). To be precise, it's about 33 oz; not a significant difference but still noticeable.

In conclusion, the Hydrapeak Voyager 40oz Tumbler with Handle and Straw in Apricot Crush has proven to be a reliable and stylish sidekick in my day-to-day life. It may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth considering for anyone in search of a reasonably priced and functional tumbler.

The number of [metal straws](https://best.serp.co/shop/metal-straws/) included with each water bottle may vary depending on the brand and model you choose. Some bottles may come with one straw, while others might include two or more. Always check the product description to confirm the specific contents of your chosen water bottle.

### Are metal straws safe to use?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Metal+Water+Bottles+with+Straws-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Metal Water Bottles with Straws-4"></a></div>

Yes, metal straws are generally safe to use as long as they are made from food-grade stainless steel. This type of steel does not leach any harmful chemicals or substances into your beverages and can be reused numerous times without any health risks.

### How do I clean my metal straw?

Cleaning metal straws is easy. First, rinse the straw thoroughly with warm water to remove any residue. Next, use a small brush or [pipe cleaner](https://best.serp.co/shop/pipe-cleaner/) to clean the inside of the straw, ensuring there's no debris left behind. For a more thorough cleaning, you can also soak the straw in a solution of warm water and dish soap for a few minutes before rinsing it again. Some metal straws come with a special cleaning brush for easy maintenance.

### Can I put hot beverages in a metal water bottle with a straw?

While you can technically put hot beverages in a metal water bottle, it is not recommended to do so with a straw attached. Metal straws can become extremely hot when in contact with hot liquids, which increases the risk of burns. Always remove the straw before filling the bottle with hot beverages.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Metal+Water+Bottles+with+Straws-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Metal Water Bottles with Straws-5"></a></div>

### How long do metal water bottles last?

The longevity of a metal water bottle depends on factors such as quality, maintenance, and usage patterns. High-quality water bottles made from stainless steel can last several years or even longer if properly cared for. Regular cleaning, proper storage, and avoiding harsh chemicals will help maintain the integrity of the bottle and ensure it lasts as long as possible.

### How do I ensure my metal straw doesn't rust?

To prevent rust on your metal straw, always store it in a dry place between uses. Avoid exposing it to harsh chemicals such as bleach or ammonia, as these can accelerate the rusting process. If you notice any signs of rust, clean your straw thoroughly with a brush or pipe cleaner and soapy water, then dry it completely before storing.

### What are the advantages of using a metal water bottle with a straw?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/metal-water-bottles-with-straws"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Metal+Water+Bottles+with+Straws-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Metal Water Bottles with Straws-6"></a></div>

- Durability: Metal water bottles are more resistant to damage than plastic or glass alternatives.

- Sustainability: By using a reusable metal water bottle, you're reducing your reliance on single-use plastics and contributing to a greener environment.

- Convenience: Metal water bottles with straws make drinking water on-the-go easier and more comfortable than sipping directly from the bottle.

- Versatility: Many metal water bottles can be used for both hot and cold beverages, making them suitable for a variety of occasions and settings.

### How do I know if a metal water bottle with a straw is leak-proof?

Before purchasing a metal water bottle, check the product description and customer reviews to determine if it has a leak-proof design. Look for bottles with secure lids and gaskets that create a tight seal. Some manufacturers also conduct leak tests on their products before shipping to ensure they meet high-quality standards.

### Can I freeze my metal water bottle with a straw?

While some metal water bottles can be frozen, it is not recommended to freeze those with attached straws. The freezing process can cause the straw to become brittle and susceptible to cracking or breaking. Instead, remove the straw before placing the bottle in the freezer and reattach it once your beverage has thawed.
