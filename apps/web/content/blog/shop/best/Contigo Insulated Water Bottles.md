### [24 oz Contigo AUTOSEAL Chill Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-insulated-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-insulated-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="contigo-water-bottle-24-ounce-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-water-bottle-24-ounce-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Contigo Water Bottle for quite some time now and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my day-to-day life. The thermalock double-walled vacuum insulation really does keep my water cold all day, no matter where I go. The autoseal technology is also quite impressive as it eliminates spills and leaks while making it incredibly easy to drink from.

One feature that I absolutely love is the protective spout cover, which keeps germs and dirt off the mouthpiece when not in use. This level of hygiene is a big plus for me, especially during these trying times. The integrated carrying handle is another convenient addition that makes transporting this water bottle super easy, whether I'm running errands or working out at the gym.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this product. Firstly, it is quite heavy due to its stainless steel construction. This might not be an issue for some people, but if you have any wrist or elbow issues, it could potentially cause some discomfort. Another issue is the fact that the lid isn't dishwasher safe - you can only wash the body of the bottle in the dishwasher and hand wash the lid instead.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Contigo Water Bottle if you're looking for a reliable and well-insulated option that keeps your water cold for hours on end. The ease of use and hygienic design are also added bonuses that make this an exceptional choice for anyone in need of a good-quality water bottle.

I recently picked up the Contigo Cortland Chill 2.0 Autoseal Stainless Steel Water Bottle in a lovely Periwinkle color, and it's been a game-changer for staying hydrated throughout my day. This sleek and stylish bottle has quickly become my go-to accessory for both workouts and casual days at the office.

One of the standout features of this bottle is its AUTOSEAL technology. With just a push of a button, I can take a swig and then easily seal it back up for spill-proof safety. It's perfect for keeping my desk and bag free from any accidental leaks. And speaking of safety, the button lock ensures that my bottle won't accidentally open up in my bag, which has happened with other bottles I've tried.

Another benefit of this bottle is its double-wall vacuum-insulated stainless steel body. This design keeps my cold drinks chilled for up to 24 hours and my hot beverages steamy for six hours. It's been a lifesaver during long workdays when I rely on [hot tea](https://best.serp.co/shop/hot-tea/)tea to keep me going. Plus, the integrated handle makes it easy to carry around and swings out of the way when not in use.

Cleaning this bottle is also a breeze, thanks to its top-rack dishwasher-safe lid and an easy-to-open underside for those deep cleans. Additionally, it fits perfectly in most car cup holders, making it a convenient choice for road trips or daily commutes.

However, there is one minor downside that I've noticed. The spout cover doesn't always seem to stay in place, especially when the bottle is being carried or knocked around. It's not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice if this issue were addressed in future models.

Overall, the Contigo Cortland Chill 2.0 Autoseal Stainless Steel Water Bottle has made a significant positive impact on my daily hydration routine. Its innovative technology, long-lasting insulation, and easy-to-clean design make it a must-have accessory for anyone looking to stay hydrated while on-the-go.
