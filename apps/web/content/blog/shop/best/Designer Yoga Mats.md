### [All-Purpose Non-Slip Yoga Mat for Comfort and Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-extra-thick-yoga-mat-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-extra-thick-yoga-mat-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried multiple mats in search of the perfect blend of comfort and support.](https://gist.github.com/acodereviewersbestfriend2/fe2153a921214edb66c0ca332dab1653) The BalanceFrom GoYoga All-Purpose Extra Thick Yoga Mat has won me over with its 1/2 inch thickness and premium quality. This extra cushioning has made a significant difference, particularly during my practice on hard floors.

The double-sided non-slip surfaces offer excellent grip, giving me peace of mind while performing intense poses or when things get a little sweaty. It's also a breeze to clean, thanks to the moisture-resistant technology, which allows me to wash it with soap and water easily.

One feature that stands out is the easy-to-use strapping system, making transport and storage hassle-free. The strap ensures that I can carry it anywhere without causing strain, even during long commutes to my yoga studio.

However, there is room for improvement - the strap could be made longer, allowing it to be slung across my shoulder more comfortably. Additionally, some users have reported that the thickness may not be consistent throughout the entire mat.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the BalanceFrom GoYoga All-Purpose Extra Thick Yoga Mat. Its comfort, support, grip, and portability make it an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their yoga practice.

[I was on the hunt for a new yoga mat last month when a friend recommended the Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) I have to say, I've never felt more comfort and support during my yoga sessions. The extra-thick 1cm foam provides cushioning for my knees and wrists, and it's surprisingly lightweight and easy to carry around with the included carrying strap.

One of the things that stood out most to me about this mat is its durability. I've been using it for almost a month now, and it still looks brand new, despite being dragged to and from the gym several times a week. The non-slip ridges on the surface of the mat have also been a welcome feature; they give me extra grip during downward dogs and other challenging poses.

However, one downside I encountered with this mat is that it tends to squeak when I move between poses on damp feet. This can be a little distracting during yoga classes, but I've found that wiping it down with a damp cloth before use helps to minimize the noise.

In addition to its durability and grip, I also love the variety of colors this mat comes in. I opted for the bold red one, but there are plenty of other options to suit any style. Overall, the Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat has been a game-changer for my yoga practice, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new mat.

### [Marrakesh Print 5mm Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Get ready to strike a pose with Gaiam's Printed Marrakesh Yoga Mat! This vibrant 5mm mat features a delicate printed medallion pattern that adds a touch of zen to your practice. The medium thickness provides ample cushioning for your joints while maintaining stability during even the most intense flows.

I personally love the Marrakesh Yoga Mat for its comfortable feel and beautiful design. The colors are vibrant and really help set the mood for a calming yoga session. The non-slip surface has been a game-changer in my practice, keeping me stable and secure during those tricky balancing poses.

However, there are a few small drawbacks to consider. Some users have mentioned receiving a different design than what they ordered, which can be discouraging. Additionally, the strong odor it emits upon first use can be off-putting for some, but I found that airing it out for a few days helped significantly.

In conclusion, if you're looking to invest in a stylish and practical yoga mat that offers great support and comfort, Gaiam's Printed Marrakesh Yoga Mat is definitely worth considering. Just make sure to verify the design before placing your order and give it time to air out before your first use.

### [Yoga Mat and Knee Pad with Carrying Strap and Blocks](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Balancefrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat with Strap, Knee Pad & Blocks in a lovely shade of pink. As someone who's been practicing yoga for a few years now, I can attest to the importance of having a comfortable and reliable mat. After using this one for several sessions, I've found it to be a solid choice.

One of the standout features of this mat is its thickness. The 1-inch high-density foam does an excellent job of cushioning my spine, hips, knees, and elbows on hard floors. It's made a noticeable difference in my comfort during practice. Plus, the double-sided non-slip surfaces provide ample traction to prevent any accidents.

Another thing I love about this mat is its size. At 71"x24", it offers plenty of space for me to spread out and move freely during my yoga practice. And when I'm finished, the lightweight design and carrying strap make it easy to pack up and take with me wherever I go.

However, there is one minor issue I've noticed. After using the mat for a few weeks, I've seen that the ends tend to curl up a bit. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it does make me wish the mat stayed perfectly flat.

All in all, the Balancefrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat with Strap, Knee Pad & Blocks has been a great addition to my yoga practice. Its thickness, size, and portability make it a top choice for anyone looking to enhance their practice.

### [Lomi Eco-Friendly Fitness Yoga Mat - Teal](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="lomi-fitness-yoga-mat-with-slip-free-material-teal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lomi-fitness-yoga-mat-with-slip-free-material-teal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had been on the lookout for a workout mat that would provide the perfect balance of comfort and stability, and the Lomi Fitness Yoga Mat seemed to fit the bill. The moment I unrolled it, I was impressed by the soft, eco-friendly TPE material that felt just right under my hands and feet. Even better, the 8mm thickness offered adequate cushioning for my knees and joints during my yoga workouts.

What really stood out to me was the slip-free feature. It's a lifesaver during those intense yoga sessions, preventing any unwanted movements and giving me the freedom to focus solely on my poses. Plus, the fact that it's foldable and easy to carry made it a breeze to take with me whenever I felt like hitting the mat.

However, I must admit that there were some cons as well. The first issue I encountered was the mat's size. While it might be suitable for most people, it felt slightly short for someone like me who's on the taller side. Additionally, I noticed that the colors started to fade slightly after several weeks of use.

Despite these minor setbacks, overall, I've been extremely satisfied with the Lomi Fitness Yoga Mat. It's durable, comfortable, and offers a secure grip – everything I needed to make my home workout sessions more enjoyable.

### [Persian Pattern Yoga Mat by DOIY Design](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/designer-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="doiy-design-yoga-mat-persian-rug-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/doiy-design-yoga-mat-persian-rug-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the DOIY Design Yoga Mat with a beautiful Persian rug design, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily yoga practice. This thick, lightweight mat provides ample cushioning, making it comfortable to use anywhere I go. I especially love that it has a natural gripping surface, which helps me maintain my balance during even the most challenging poses.

Measuring at 173 x 60 cm, this mat is the perfect size for any yoga fan. Its material is designed to absorb movement, ensuring that I stay comfortable and focused throughout my session. Plus, the stylish pattern adds a touch of elegance to my home gym setup. However, I have noticed that the initial unboxing comes with a bit of an unpleasant odor, but a quick wash remedies that.

Another bonus of this yoga mat is its portability. It rolls up easily and comes with a strap, which makes it super easy to take with me wherever I go. Overall, I'm incredibly happy with my purchase and would highly recommend the DOIY Design Yoga Mat to any fellow yogis out there.

### Important Features

When shopping for a designer yoga mat, consider the material, thickness, and surface texture. High-quality materials like natural rubber or eco-friendly PVC can provide good grip and cushioning, while thinner mats are better for travel. The surface texture should offer non-slip traction for stability during yoga poses.

### Considerations

One of the key considerations is the size and portability of the mat. Smaller mats are easier to carry, but you may prefer a larger one for more space during practice. Durability is also important, so look for mats with sturdy construction and reinforcement around high-wear areas like the edges.
