### [Gaiam 6mm Odor-Free Yoga Mat with Free Workout Class](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Gaiam Premium Print Yoga Mat has been quite interesting. I've always been averse to the idea of yoga, but this mat just made it feel more appealing. The moment I got it, I was drawn to its beautiful Indigo Point design. It's not just attractive, it also helps me maintain proper alignment during my practice, which I thought was pretty cool.

One thing that really impressed me about this mat is its thickness. At 6mm, it provides just the right level of cushioning that I need to protect my joints while I stretch and twist. Plus, it's free from harmful phthalates, making it a healthier choice for both me and the environment. However, I did notice a slight odor when I first unwrapped it, but airing it out for a few days took care of that.

However, there are a few downsides as well. The surface of the mat can be a bit slippery at times, especially when I get a little sweaty during intense sessions. And while it's portable, it's not the lightest mat out there, which can be a bit of a pain when I have to carry it around.

Overall, I must say that this yoga mat has been a game-changer for me. Its appealing design, comfortable thickness, and eco-friendly materials make it a great addition to my daily practice. While it may not be perfect, its pros outweigh the cons, and I can definitely recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their yoga journey.

### [Celestial Blue Gaiam 6mm Premium Yoga Mat for Home or Studio](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-print-yoga-mat-celestial-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-print-yoga-mat-celestial-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried several yoga mats in my quest for the perfect one. However, the Gaiam 6mm Premium Print Yoga Mat in Celestial Blue has truly captured my heart. Its beautiful celestial print adds a touch of ethereal charm to my yoga practice, making me feel like I'm practicing while gazing at the stars.

Made from latex-free PVC, this yoga mat offers a thickness of 6mm that provides exceptional cushioning. The surface has a textured, "sticky" feel that helps me maintain my balance during different poses without any trouble. I love its non-slip feature which ensures I can perform all yoga styles without worrying about slipping.

Ideal for both home and studio usage, this mat comes with a lifetime guarantee from Gaiam, giving me peace of mind about its durability. Its dimensions, i. e. , 68 inches long and 24 inches wide, make it a comfortable fit for most people.

There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to odor elimination at first. But, following proper care instructions such as airing out the mat for a few days after receiving it can help in reducing the strong odor significantly. Furthermore, spot cleaning with a damp cloth and mild detergent can easily maintain its cleanliness.

However, if you are planning to use this product in direct sunlight for extended periods, be prepared to see some fading and brittleness. I've found that keeping it in a shaded space helps preserve its vibrant color and texture.

While the overall performance and aesthetics of the Gaiam 6mm Premium Print Yoga Mat are top-notch, it's worth mentioning that some users may find its thickness a bit too soft, making joints feel unsupported. It might not be the best option for those who prefer firmer mats.

In conclusion, the Gaiam 6mm Premium Print Yoga Mat in Celestial Blue is an excellent choice for yogis looking for a visually striking yet comfortable and durable mat for their practice. Its high-quality craftsmanship, exceptional features, and lifetime guarantee make it a worthwhile investment for any serious yogi. However, be aware of its softness and the proper care required to eliminate strong odor.

### [Gaiam Metallic Sunset 6mm Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-premium-metallic-sunset-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-metallic-sunset-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Gaiam Premium Metallic Sunset Yoga Mat, and boy, has it been a game-changer in my daily yoga routine! This beautiful 6mm thick mat offers the perfect balance between comfort and stability with its cushioned padding and textured non-slip surface. It's made from latex-free PVC and free of any harmful plasticisers.

One highlight of this mat is how stylish it looks with its metallic design. While appearance might not be everything, it certainly contributes to the overall experience of practicing yoga on this mat. Plus, the pattern on the mat helps you easily check your alignment during poses.

The main downside I found was that when using the product for the first time, it had a strong chemical smell that took over 12 hours to dissipate. This may have been due to the PVC material, but thankfully after some airing out sessions, the odour disappeared completely.

In conclusion, I would recommend the Gaiam Premium Metallic Sunset Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a comfortable, well-made, and visually appealing addition to their daily yoga practice. However, be prepared for an initial chemical smell that requires some patience before it fades away.

### [Gaiam 4mm Pink Marrakesh Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-4mm-yoga-mat-pink-marrakesh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-4mm-yoga-mat-pink-marrakesh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam 4mm Yoga Mat in Pink Marrakesh for my home practice, and I must say it has been an absolute game-changer. As a yoga enthusiast, I had heard rave reviews about Gaiam's mats from friends and online forums, and now I understand why. The mat's texture provides an excellent grip that has significantly improved my balance and stability during various poses.

From the moment I unrolled the mat, I could tell it was made with high-quality materials. Its thickness of 4mm offers ample cushioning for my knees and wrists while maintaining proper alignment throughout my practice. I particularly appreciate how lightweight this mat is, making it easy to transport to and from classes or when I practice outside.

One aspect that initially concerned me was the odor upon unpacking. However, the instructions recommended airing it out for a couple of days, and the smell dissipated completely. I also followed the advice to wipe it down with a damp cloth before using it, which helped improve its grip further.

Despite the minor inconvenience of the odor, I would highly recommend the Gaiam 4mm Yoga Mat. Its durability and portability make it an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their yoga practice at home or on-the-go. Plus, knowing that it's manufactured free of harmful phthalates gives me peace of mind about using it regularly.

### [Gaiam 6mm Reversible Yoga Mat with Kaleidoscope Sea Design](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-reversible-yoga-mat-kaleidoscope-sea-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-reversible-yoga-mat-kaleidoscope-sea-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam Reversible Yoga Mat - Kaleidoscope Sea and have been thoroughly impressed with its quality and design. This yoga mat not only adds a touch of style to my practice but also provides the optimal comfort and support.

The two-sided design is striking, making it difficult to decide which side to use each day. The thickness is particularly noticeable and offers a cushioned surface that's incredibly comfortable for my knees during poses on the floor.

However, I must admit there was an initial strong odor when I first unrolled the mat. Fortunately, after airing it out for a day and applying some essential oils, the smell dissipated significantly.

The grip isn't perfect, but it's sufficient for maintaining stability during most poses. Some users have reported issues with slipperiness, especially when they start to sweat. Personally, I haven't encountered this problem, but it might be worth considering if you tend to sweat a lot during exercise.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this yoga mat and would highly recommend it to others looking to enhance their practice. I believe that the combination of its comfortable thickness, beautiful design, and good value makes it a standout choice among other yoga mats on the market.

- Who will use the mat? If multiple people will use the same mat, choose a durable one with a good grip.
