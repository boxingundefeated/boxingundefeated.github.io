<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="simple-modern-nba-los-angeles-clippers-32oz-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-insulated-stainless-steel-su-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-nba-los-angeles-clippers-32oz-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-insulated-stainless-steel-su-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Simple Modern NBA Los Angeles Clippers 32oz Water Bottle with StrawBottle with Straw Lid. At work, I'm always on the go and need something to keep me hydrated and refreshed.

This bottle really stood out for me. The vacuum insulation is a game-changer, ensuring my water stays chilly for hours on end. Plus, you won't catch it leaking, not even when that straw lid is in the wrong position thanks to its leak-proof design.

The bottle itself is made with a hardy, stainless steel construction that's holding up against my not-so-gentle use. And, as an additional bonus, it's adorned with the iconic Los Angeles Clippers emblem. With this water bottle, I've never felt more like a fan. However, it was a bit of a hassle to hand wash, I wish it was dishwasher-safe.

So, if you're looking for an insulated water bottle that not only preserves the temperature of your beverage but also looks cool and vibrant, this Simple Modern NBA bottle should definitely be on your radar! Just make sure to rinse it by hand after use.

### [NFL Washington Commanders Metal Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="simple-modern-nfl-washington-commanders-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-nfl-washington-commanders-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid fan of the Washington Commanders, I simply couldn't resist trying out the Simple Modern NFL Washington Commanders Water Bottle. I've been using this bottle for a while now, and I must say, it's been quite an enjoyable experience.

The first thing that caught my attention is its ability to keep my drink cold for hours on end. The double-walled insulation is truly effective, and I find myself refilling it less often than my previous bottle. Furthermore, the leak-proof straw lid is a game-changer; I no longer have to deal with water spillage on my gym bag.

The bottle's construction is top-notch as well. The 18/8 stainless steel is both rust-resistant and food-grade, ensuring my drink is safe and delicious. Additionally, the exterior has a polished, durable finish that's easy to clean and maintain.

However, I did notice a few cons while using this bottle. Firstly, it's not suitable for hot or carbonated beverages, which limits its versatility. Secondly, the bottle isn't suitable for dishwashers, so hand washing is necessary. Lastly, the straw lid's design can be slightly tricky, as it may require some effort to drink from at times.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Simple Modern NFL Washington Commanders Water Bottle. Its excellent insulation, leak-proof lid, and premium build quality make it a must-have for any football fan. While it may have some minor drawbacks, these are easily overshadowed by its exceptional performance and stylish design.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="simple-modern-50-oz-mug-tumbler-with-handle-and-straw-lid-reusable-insulated-stainless-steel-large-t-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-50-oz-mug-tumbler-with-handle-and-straw-lid-reusable-insulated-stainless-steel-large-t-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Simple Modern 50 oz Mug Tumbler, and let me tell you, it has become my go-to companion for my daily adventures. The first thing that caught my eye was its large capacity, which helps me stay hydrated with fewer refills. I usually struggle with remembering to drink water, but with this tumbler, I find myself sipping throughout the day without even realizing it.

One of the features I absolutely love is the leak-resistant straw lid. It keeps my beverages from spilling all over my car or bag, making it perfect for on-the-go use. Plus, the double wall insulation ensures that my [hot tea](https://best.serp.co/shop/hot-tea/)tea stays hot for hours, and my iced coffee stays cold even on the hottest days.

Now, let's talk about durability. This tumbler is made of premium 18/8 stainless steel, which means it can withstand my clumsy moments without denting or scratching. It's also available in a wide range of colors, so I can easily find one that matches my style or outfit.

However, there's one thing that could be improved - the handle. While it's comfortable to hold, I sometimes find it a bit too wide for my small hands. It would be great if there were other handle options for people with smaller hands.

In conclusion, the Simple Modern 50 oz Mug Tumbler has been a game-changer for me. Its spacious capacity, leak-resistant straw lid, and excellent insulation make it perfect for staying hydrated on the go. Although the handle could be slightly improved, it doesn't detract from the overall quality and performance of this fantastic tumbler.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="simple-modern-tritan-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-12oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-tritan-water-bottle-with-straw-lid-12oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a mom of two little ones, I was excited to try out the Simple Modern Tritan Water Bottle with Straw Lid. This 12oz bottle has been a game-changer for my youngest who was struggling with using a straw. The lightweight and durable construction made it easy for her to handle, and she loves the variety of patterns available.

One feature that really stands out is the ease of cleaning. All parts are dishwasher safe on the top rack, which ensures hygienic use and maintains the bottle's durability. Plus, it's cupholder friendly with a base diameter of 2.9 inches, making it perfect for school or outings.

However, there have been some issues with leaking when using the straw lid. Some users reported leakage even if the straw was left open, while others noticed that cold liquids can sometimes cause the bottle to leak more. Despite these cons, I still appreciate the overall functionality and design of this bottle, which has helped my daughter drink more water and develop her motor skills.

In conclusion, the Simple Modern Tritan Water Bottle with Straw Lid is an attractive and well-made product that promotes hydration for kids. While it may not be entirely leakproof, its durability and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for parents looking for a practical and stylish water bottle for their children.

One thing that amazed me about this bottle was its leakproof feature. This helped me avoid any spills or messes in my bag. Plus, it comes with a BPA-free straw lid, making it super easy to drink on-the-go. I also love that it's dishwasher safe, so I don't have to spend hours hand washing my bottle.

However, I must admit, the bottle is not so great with hot liquids or carbonated beverages. Due to pressure build-up inside, the bottle may leak or spill. But hey, we can't have everything, right?

All in all, the Simple Modern Collegiate Water Bottle has been a valuable addition to my daily routine. Its durability, capacity, and leak-proof features have made it my go-to bottle for staying hydrated throughout the day.

### 2. How do Simple Modern Water Bottles keep drinks hot or cold?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Simple+Modern+Water+Bottles-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Simple Modern Water Bottles-4"></a></div>

### 4. Can Simple Modern Water Bottles be used for carrying hot and cold beverages simultaneously?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/simple-modern-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Simple+Modern+Water+Bottles-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Simple Modern Water Bottles-5"></a></div>

To clean your Simple Modern Water Bottle, wash it thoroughly with warm soapy water. You can also use a [bottle brush](https://best.serp.co/shop/bottle-brush/) to reach the bottom and interior sides.
