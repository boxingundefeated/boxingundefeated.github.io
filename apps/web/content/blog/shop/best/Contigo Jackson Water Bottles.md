<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-jackson-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently incorporated the Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle into my daily routine, and it has been a game-changer! The carbon fiber filter technology significantly reduces the chlorine taste and odor in my water, making it taste incredibly refreshing. I also appreciate how leakproof it is - no spills on my desk or in my car.

What I love most about this bottle is its convenience. The angled straw ensures I can easily sip every last drop, while the integrated handle makes it easy to carry around one-handed. Plus, the lid has a button lock that prevents accidents. It's perfect for traveling or heading to the gym, as it keeps my drinks cold all day long.

However, there are some minor issues. The filter does need to be replaced, which can be a bit cumbersome, and sometimes the bottle can make squeaking noises when used.

### [24 oz Contigo AUTOSEAL Chill Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-jackson-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-jackson-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="contigo-water-bottle-24-ounce-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-water-bottle-24-ounce-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Contigo Water Bottle for quite some time now and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my day-to-day life. The thermalock double-walled vacuum insulation really does keep my water cold all day, no matter where I go. The autoseal technology is also quite impressive as it eliminates spills and leaks while making it incredibly easy to drink from.

One feature that I absolutely love is the protective spout cover, which keeps germs and dirt off the mouthpiece when not in use. This level of hygiene is a big plus for me, especially during these trying times. The integrated carrying handle is another convenient addition that makes transporting this water bottle super easy, whether I'm running errands or working out at the gym.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this product. Firstly, it is quite heavy due to its stainless steel construction. This might not be an issue for some people, but if you have any wrist or elbow issues, it could potentially cause some discomfort. Another issue is the fact that the lid isn't dishwasher safe - you can only wash the body of the bottle in the dishwasher and hand wash the lid instead.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Contigo Water Bottle if you're looking for a reliable and well-insulated option that keeps your water cold for hours on end. The ease of use and hygienic design are also added bonuses that make this an exceptional choice for anyone in need of a good-quality water bottle.

In terms of cons, I've noticed that this bottle doesn't fit in my car's cup holders, which might be a bit inconvenient for some users. Additionally, the locking mechanism can be tricky to master initially, but it gets better with practice.
