One downside though, it's not [microwave](https://best.serp.co/shop/microwaves/) safe, so you'll have to heat up your drinks separately. However, this water bottle's top-rack dishwasher safe feature more than makes up for it. It's super convenient to clean, especially with its wide mouth design.

Overall, I feel safe using this bottle as it's BPA-free. It's a great companion for work, school, or even a hike. [If you're looking for a stylish and functional water bottle, this Sanrio Hello Kitty bottle is definitely worth considering!](https://gist.github.com/bestcreditcardsmerchantaccounts/7400fc4d13a12196ced4c780b1e2a690)

As a product reviewer, I've had the pleasure of using the Hello Kitty and Pusheen Reusable Stainless Steel Hot & Cold Thermal Insulated Drinks Bottle. This little bottle has been my faithful companion during my daily commute, keeping my morning coffee warm and my afternoon smoothie ice-cold. The stainless steel body, polypropylene lid, and silicone seal make it incredibly hardwearing and leakproof - I've dropped it a few times and it's still going strong!

One of the standout features for me is the double-walled design. Whether I'm filling it with [hot tea](https://best.serp.co/shop/hot-tea/)tea or iced lemonade, this bottle keeps the temperature just right. It's also quite spacious, with a 530ml capacity that easily fits my largest tumbler of coffee or a generous serving of smoothie.

However, there's a minor issue with this bottle. Despite its many strong points, it's not dishwasher safe. This means I need to take the time to wash it by hand, which can be a bit of a hassle after a long day.

Overall, I've had a great experience with this bottle. Its durable construction, double-walled design, and size make it perfect for my needs. While the hand-washing requirement is slightly inconvenient, it's definitely worth the trade-off for such a high-quality product.

### [Thermos 12oz Funtainer Jojo Siwa Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pusheen-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pusheen-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="thermos-12oz-funtainer-water-bottle-with-bail-handle-jojo-siwa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-12oz-funtainer-water-bottle-with-bail-handle-jojo-siwa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a Thermos 12oz Funtainer Water Bottle with Bail Handle, featuring Jojo Siwa's design, for my little one. I must say, it's been a game-changer in our daily routine!

First off, the vacuum insulation technology is amazing. I fill it up with cold water in the morning, and by lunchtime, the water is still chilled, just as advertised. This means no more half-drunk lukewarm water sitting around all day, which is a major win for us.

The stainless steel interior and exterior have proven to be incredibly durable. My kid is not exactly gentle with their belongings, but this bottle has withstood all the roughhousing and has yet to show any signs of wear and tear.

The push button lid with pop-up straw is another feature worth mentioning. It makes drinking super easy, especially for young children who might struggle with twist-off caps. Plus, it's leak-proof when closed, so no spills in the lunchbox or backpack!

However, there are a couple of minor cons to consider. Firstly, the bottle isn't suitable for hot liquids, which could be a limitation for some users. Secondly, the size might be too large or small for some. Personal preference plays a significant role here.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the Thermos 12oz Funtainer Water Bottle with Bail Handle. It's a fantastic addition to our daily life, and I know we'll get plenty of use out of it!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pusheen-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="pusheen-glass-water-bottle-clear-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pusheen-glass-water-bottle-clear-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who loves water bottles with unique designs, I've been using the Pusheen Glass Water Bottle for a while now, and it's quickly become my go-to. The first thing I noticed about this bottle is how clear and high-quality the glass feels - it's not just some flimsy plastic that feels like it'll fall apart if you look at it funny! Not to mention, I love how easy it is to clean under running water, though you definitely shouldn't put it in the dishwasher or microwave.

One thing that really stood out to me with this bottle is how well it keeps my drinks cold or hot. It's such a relief not to get handed a lukewarm bottle when I ask for a drink at the gym! Oh, and let's not forget the adorable Pusheen design on the outside â€“ it's definitely the icing on the cake for me.

However, I will say that while the bottle claims to be leak-free, I've noticed that it starts to leak a bit over time, especially when carried in a bag with other items. I also want to mention that you definitely shouldn't use this bottle for carbonated beverages - it's not built for that and can definitely let some bubbly escapes if you try.

But despite these minor issues, I've been really happy with my Pusheen Glass Water Bottle, and I feel like it's definitely upped my water intake game! It's definitely a big plus for anyone who wants to reduce their carbon footprint and enjoy a refreshing drink on the go.
