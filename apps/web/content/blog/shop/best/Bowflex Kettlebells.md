I recently added the Apex, Adjustable Kettlebell to my home gym routine and I must say, it's a game-changer. This versatile piece of equipment is a complete weight set that's perfect for muscle building and weight lifting.

One thing I love about this kettlebell is its adjustability. The weight can be customized between 20 and 50 pounds by replacing the removable spacer disks with standard 2.5, 5, or 10-pound weights (sold separately). This feature makes it easy for me to challenge myself as my fitness level improves, without needing to buy multiple kettlebells.

The build quality of the Apex Kettlebell is impressive too. It's made from solid cast-iron and reinforced with a powder coating, making it incredibly durable. I've been using this kettlebell regularly for months now and there's no signs of wear or damage whatsoever.

The traditional u-bar handle is another standout feature. It provides optimal grip control, allowing me to perform large movements with ease and precision. This has been especially helpful during tough workouts when I need maximum control over the weight.

In terms of exercise versatility, the Apex Adjustable Kettlebell truly shines. [Whether you're lifting, swinging, toning, or building muscle, this kettlebell delivers an effective workout.](https://best.serp.co/shop/kettlebell-weight/) I've found it particularly useful for circuit training and bodybuilding routines.

However, one drawback is that the weighted [plates](https://best.serp.co/shop/plates/) are not included, which means you'll need to purchase them separately.

The handle is ergonomic, making it comfortable to grip even during the most intense workouts. And the weight is distributed evenly, ensuring smooth movements no matter what exercise you're doing.

I must admit, there is one minor drawback. Due to the adjustable weights inside, it has a wider bottom half. This can limit your range of motion for some exercises, but a quick step or box can help you get around this.

Overall, the Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell has been an absolute pleasure to use. It's versatile, easy to adjust, and well-made. Plus, the free JRNY Mobile-Only Membership that comes with it offers trainer-led workouts and other cool features to keep your workouts fresh and exciting.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the size of these weights can feel bulkier when using them, especially at higher weight settings.
