Not only does it replace 4 of the most popular kettlebell weights in one compact unit, but it also offers unparalleled comfort, balance, and a sturdy feel similar to a solid iron kettlebell.

The contoured shell design is a game-changer when it comes to the ease of use and adjustment. The selector pin mechanism makes weight changes super quick and straightforward, so I don't have to waste time during my workout sessions. And with an all-steel construction, I know I'm getting a high-quality piece of fitness equipment that'll last for years to come.

While it may have some minor drawbacks, its unique adjustability, comfort, and sturdy construction make it a top pick for any fitness aficionado seeking a space-saving workout solution.

The SmartStack is also incredibly comfortable to use, with a good grip that allows for smooth transitions between exercises. Its sturdy construction ensures durability and longevity, making it a worthwhile investment for any fitness enthusiast.

However, not everything about the SmartStack is perfect. Some users have reported sharp edges on the product, which can be uncomfortable during certain exercises. I've seen this issue mentioned by a couple of reviewers, and it's worth considering before making a purchase.

I've been using the FitRx SmartStack for several months now, and it has certainly become an indispensable part of my home workout routine. Its adjustable weights provide versatility and convenience, allowing me to focus on my fitness goals rather than manage multiple kettlebells.
