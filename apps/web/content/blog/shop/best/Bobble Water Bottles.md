<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/bobble-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="bubba-kids-bottle-crystle-ice-with-rock-candy-kiwi-color-wash-flo-refresh-16-ounces-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bubba-kids-bottle-crystle-ice-with-rock-candy-kiwi-color-wash-flo-refresh-16-ounces-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the opportunity to try out the Bubba Flo Kids Water Bottle with Silicone Sleeve. The first thing that caught my eye was its bright and appealing design, perfect for grabbing my kid's attention.

The bottle features a leak-proof lid with a button lock that prevents accidental openings. It's perfect for those long car rides or school trips where we don't want any spills. But what really made me happy is the wide-mouth chug lid, which allows me to fill up the bottle quickly and conveniently.

One of the best parts about this water bottle is the easy-to-grip silicone sleeve. Not only does it keep the bottle from slipping out of my kid's hands, but it also helps keep the drinks cold longer and reduces condensation. Plus, when you need to clean it, you can simply pop off the sleeve and throw the lid and body onto the top rack of your dishwasher.

In our daily life, it has quickly become a staple item. The durability of this bottle is impressive. Despite being dropped a few times by my little one, the bottle remains intact and fully functional.

There are no unpleasant aftertastes from the bottle material, which is a common issue with some [plastic water bottles](https://best.serp.co/shop/plastic-water-bottles/). And as a parent, I appreciate that the bottle is made from impact-, stain-, and odor-resistant BPA-free plastic, ensuring that my kid's water is free from harmful chemicals.

However, there's one minor drawback. The silicone sleeve doesn't provide much insulation, so the water doesn't stay cold for too long when outdoors. But that's a small price to pay considering all the other great features of this bottle.

In conclusion, the Bubba Flo Kids Water Bottle with Silicone Sleeve is a fantastic addition to our daily routine. Its appealing design, leak-proof lid, and easy-to-grip sleeve make it a favorite among parents and kids alike. With its durability, ease of use and clean, my child now enjoys staying hydrated with joy.
