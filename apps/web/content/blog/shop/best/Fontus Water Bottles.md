### [Thermos Funtainer Bottle: Refreshing 12-Hour Cold Drinks](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounce-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounce-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The ThermosThermos Funtainer Bottle is a game changer that's making waves in the world of children's hydration. With its 12 oz size, it's perfect for keeping my kids quenched on even the hottest days. I've had my fair share of water bottles that didn't live up to their promises, but the Funtainer Bottle genuinely keeps drinks cold for up to 12 hours.

One aspect that really stands out is its sturdy and reliable construction. The double wall stainless steel interior and exterior make it a great companion for my kids' rough-and-tumble activities. Additionally, the pop-up straw and integrated carry handle are both hygienic and easy for them to use.

However, there are some minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Hand washing is recommended, which can be a bit of a hassle compared to dishwasher-safe alternatives. Plus, it's not suitable for hot liquids, so if you're looking for a bottle that can do it all, this may not be the best choice.

Overall, the Thermos Funtainer Bottle has been a valuable addition to our daily routine. Its ability to keep my kids' water cold for hours on end is a feature that can't be overstated. While it does have a few minor drawbacks, they don't detract from its overall effectiveness and durability.

### [SoftBottle Collapsible 1L Water Bottle for Active Lifestyle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="platypus-softbottle-1-0l-apex-push-pull-cap-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-softbottle-1-0l-apex-push-pull-cap-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L and I've been using it extensively for my daily commute and also during my weekend hikes. This bottle has truly lived up to its claims of being lightweight, flexible, and highly packable. When empty, the bottle can easily be rolled up and tucked away in my bag, saving a lot of space that would've otherwise been taken up by a rigid water bottle.

The design of the bottle is also quite thoughtful. The narrow middle section makes it comfortable to hold and the Push-Pull Cap ensures that the bottle is leak-proof and easy to open or close. Plus, it's great to know that the materials used are BPA-free and taste-free, which is a major concern for many users.

However, I did face one issue. The bottle seems to be a bit delicate as I noticed a small leak from one of the seams after a few uses. But, I must admit that I was carrying a lot of heavy gear, so it might have been subjected to more stress than usual.

All in all, the Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L is a fantastic product that truly delivers on its promises of being lightweight, flexible, and easy to use. It's perfect for anyone who wants a reliable, easy-to-carry water bottle for their daily adventures. Just be mindful of its delicate nature and take care of it accordingly.

### [Thermos 12-Ounce Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle (Purple)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="thermos-12-ounce-stainless-steel-funtainer-bottle-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-12-ounce-stainless-steel-funtainer-bottle-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Thermos 12-ounce Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily hydration. This little bottle packs a lot of punch. The double wall vacuum insulation technology is excellent at keeping cold drinks cold for hours on end, even in the sweltering heat of summer.

The hygienic push button lid with the pop-up straw is super convenient and easy to use. Plus, it's got an integrated carry handle which is perfect for when I'm on the go. The fact that it's made of durable BPA-free stainless steel not only gives me peace of mind about the safety of my beverages but also ensures that my bottle will last through many adventures.

However, I did notice some cons. Firstly, it's not meant for hot liquids, so if you're looking for something to carry your morning coffee or tea, this might not be the best choice. Secondly, the bottle only has a 12 oz capacity, which isn't much for thirsty people like myself. Lastly, while it claims to be dishwasher safe, handwashing it would probably extend its life more.

In conclusion, the Thermos 12-ounce Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle (Purple) is a reliable companion for anyone seeking an easily portable and leak-proof way to keep their cold drinks cold throughout the day. While it may have some minor drawbacks, its overall performance and convenience make it a worthwhile purchase.

### [12 oz. Thermos Funtainer Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounces-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounces-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hey there, I recently got my hands on the Thermos 12-ounce Funtainer bottle and I've been using it non-stop since then. To say the least, it's been a game-changer for my on-the-go hydration needs.

First off, let's talk about the best part - the insulation. This baby keeps my water cold for hours, even when it's sweltering outside. Seriously, I could leave it out in the sun all day and the water would still be refreshingly chilled. If you're someone who loves a nice cold drink but hates how quickly ice melts, this bottle is going to be your best friend.

The design and build quality are also top-notch. The stainless steel exterior is super durable, so I'm not constantly worried about it getting dented or scratched up. And let's not forget about the color options - there's something for everyone!

Now, I did encounter a couple of minor issues. Cleaning this bottle can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to the straw. It's not the most convenient process and takes a bit of time. Also, while the bottle itself is leak-proof, the lid isn't. So, if you're like me and always misplacing your water bottle cap, you might want to keep an eye on this one.

Overall, I'd recommend the Thermos 12-ounce Funtainer bottle to anyone looking for a reliable, insulated water bottle that keeps their drinks cold for hours. Just remember to handle the lid with care, and you'll be good to go!

### [Stylish, Reusable Water Bottle - Perfect for Travel and School](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="pnw-components-elements-water-bottle-seafoam-teal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pnw-components-elements-water-bottle-seafoam-teal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Pnw Components Elements Water Bottle in Seafoam Teal, and I must say it has been a game-changer when it comes to staying hydrated on the go. This sleek 22 oz. bottle boasts Purist Technology that eliminates any unpleasant aftertaste, making sure my water always tastes clean and pure.

One of my favorite features of this water bottle is the Moflow Cap, which makes opening and closing the bottle super easy and leak-proof. I've been using it for everything from my morning jog to late-night hikes, and not once has it let me down!

However, there's one minor drawback - this bottle isn't insulated. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me since I usually drink cold water, it might be something to keep in mind if you're planning on using it during hot summer days or want your water to stay chilled for longer periods.

Despite its minor shortcoming, I absolutely love the Pnw Components Elements Water Bottle in Seafoam Teal. It's lightweight, easy to clean, and perfect for keeping me hydrated throughout the day.

### [Reusable 25 oz Water Bottle by Yeti](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles"><img alt="yeti-25-oz-yonder-water-bottle-charcoal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yeti-25-oz-yonder-water-bottle-charcoal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been using the Yeti - 25 oz Yonder Water Bottle in charcoal and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily hydration routine. I used to struggle with clunky, heavy water bottles that were difficult to carry and unwieldy to drink from. Yeti has truly reinvented the water bottle with their lightweight, non-insulated plastic design that's perfect for on-the-go use.

The first thing that stood out to me was the sleek design and the smooth chug cap, which is a real pleasure to drink from. The controlled spout prevents spills and leaks, making it my go-to bottle for meetings, workouts, and everything in between. The cap's two-part system is incredibly user-friendly, allowing me to twist off the top for drinking and twist off the bottom for refilling or washing - no more fumbling with twist or flip caps!

Another highlight is the bottle's 100% leak-proof performance. No more soggy purse linings or damp [office desks](https://best.serp.co/shop/office-desks/)[desks](https://best.serp.co/shop/desks/)! Plus, the non-insulated design ensures that my water stays at room temperature, which is perfect for those hot summer days when I need a refreshing chill but don't want to deal with condensation on the outside of the bottle.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks to this bottle. Firstly, it's not insulated and isn't suitable for hot or carbonated beverages. Secondly, the wider width of the bottle means that it doesn't fit in all cup holders, so you might need to keep it in a cupholder-friendly location.

All in all, I've been extremely satisfied with the Yeti - 25 oz Yonder Water Bottle and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight, stylish, and leak-proof way to stay hydrated throughout the day. Its unique design and practical features make it a standout choice for anyone who wants a reliable and durable water bottle.
