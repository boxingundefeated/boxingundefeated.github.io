### [Onnit Bigfoot 90lb Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been incorporating the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) into my workout routine, and I must say it's been a game-changer. The unique design of this kettlebell, featuring a detailed Sasquatch face, not only adds a fun twist to my exercise regimen but also inspires me to push harder and break through my fitness plateaus.

One aspect that really stands out about the Bigfoot kettlebell is its sturdiness. The solid cast iron construction makes it feel incredibly secure and reliable during even my most intense workout sessions. It's evident that Onnit took great care in crafting this piece, as evidenced by the even weight distribution and comfortable grip.

Another highlight of this product is its excellent durability. Despite using it multiple times a week for several weeks now, the paint hasn't chipped or worn off in any significant way – a testament to the high-quality materials and manufacturing process employed by Onnit.

However, one minor issue I've encountered with the Bigfoot kettlebell is the way its ears stick out. While this design choice certainly contributes to the product's eye-catching appearance, it can sometimes make certain exercises, like holding the bell by the ears during squats, feel slightly awkward or uncomfortable.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) to anyone looking to add a little excitement and motivation to their fitness routine. Its unique design, top-notch construction, and impressive durability make it an excellent addition to any home gym. Just be mindful of the ear placement if you plan on using it for specific exercises that require a comfortable grip.

### [Durable Vinyl-Coated Kettlebell Set for Fitness: 5, 10, and 15 lbs](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this Balancefrom Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set, and I must say it's a game-changer! It's perfect for incorporating into my workout routine. I particularly like the variety of weights included in this set - 5lb, 10lb, and 15lb. This has given me the flexibility to gradually increase the intensity of my workouts, keeping things interesting and effective.

One feature that stands out is the wide grip design, which provides a comfortable and secure hold while performing various exercises. It has made my movements more fluid and controlled, and I've seen a significant improvement in my balance and muscular control. Plus, the vinyl coating on the kettlebells is a nice touch, adding durability and protecting my floors from any damage.

However, there have been a few hiccups. The labeling on the weights is not as secure as I'd like. Some stickers have peeled off or lost their adhesion over time, making it difficult to tell which weight I'm using at a glance. Additionally, the packaging was a bit lackluster, with no cushioning or support for the weights, making them vulnerable to damage during transit.

In conclusion, while the Balancefrom Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set has some minor flaws, the overall experience has been quite positive. [The variety of weights, combined with the comfortable grip and durable vinyl coating, makes this set a valuable addition to any home fitness routine.](https://best.serp.co/rubber-weight-sets/)

### [Durable Matte Black Chip-Resistant Kettlebell with Flat Base](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="body-solid-kbr-powder-coated-iron-kettlebells-100lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-kbr-powder-coated-iron-kettlebells-100lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Body-Solid KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells for a while now and it's become one of my favorite workout tools. The matte-black powder coat provides an excellent grip even during intense workouts, saving me from potential injuries. Plus, the flat-bottom design ensures a stable base for safety during movement. The weight display is also a lifesaver, helping me quickly identify the right kettlebell size without any confusion.

The variety of weights available, from 5lb to 100lb, ensures that I can always find the right challenge no matter my current fitness level. However, be aware that some users might find the higher weights too heavy, especially if they're just starting out with kettlebell training. It's also worth noting that the finish might have a slight odor at first, which might be off-putting to some.

Overall, however, the Body-Solid KBR Kettlebells are an excellent addition to any fitness routine, whether at home or at the gym. The durability and convenience make them a worthwhile investment.

The unique design with a uniquely positioned handle made swinging and lifting this kettlebell a breeze. It was comfortable to grip and easy to maneuver, even when I was drenched in sweat from an intense workout session.

However, one minor issue was the paint job on some parts of the kettlebell which seemed to peel off quite easily. But fortunately, the company promptly addressed this issue and made it right, which speaks volumes about their commitment to customer satisfaction.

[From strengthening my shoulders, legs, biceps, back, and more, to being highly adaptable for home or commercial use, this kettlebell has become an indispensable part of my daily fitness routine.](https://best.serp.co/shop/kettlebell-weight/)

As a fitness enthusiast, I have always struggled to find the perfect workout equipment that provides both quality and convenience. That's when I came across the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell. This 65-pound workout powerhouse has truly revolutionized my fitness routine!

Firstly, the design comfort aspect of this kettlebell is unbeatable. The rubber coating not only adds an extra layer of protection for my floors but also provides a comfortable and secure grip during my intense workout sessions. This feature has been a game-changer for me as I used to dread using traditional metal kettlebells that would slip from my hands and cause me injuries.

The grip quality of the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell is nothing short of amazing. The premium rubber coating with a dual surface texture eliminates any potential for slippage, ensuring a safe yet intense workout every time. Plus, it adds an extra touch of style to my home gym, making it more inviting and inspiring for my daily workout sessions.

Of course, no product is perfect, and the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell does have a minor issue. The handle can be quite greasy when it first arrives, but a quick wash with some dish soap takes care of this problem instantly.

In conclusion, the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell, 65 lb has undoubtedly earned its place in my home gym. Its design comfort, grip quality, and versatility make it the perfect addition for anyone looking to take their fitness to new heights. I highly recommend giving this kettlebell a try - it might just change your life like it has mine!

### [High Quality 70 lb Cast Iron Kettlebell for Fitness Enthusiasts](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-75-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-75-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've seen celebrities and personal trainers rave about the wonders of kettlebell training, and I'm always up for a fitness challenge. As someone who enjoys a mix of strength and endurance training, I was pleasantly surprised by the kettlebell's versatility.

A standout feature of this kettlebell is its cast iron construction with a tough black enamel finish. It feels solid and well-made, giving me confidence in its durability. I appreciate that the handles on the heavier kettlebells are large enough to accommodate both hands. This design makes it easy for me to switch between one-handed and two-handed exercises without any issues.

Over the past month, I've incorporated the kettlebell into my daily workout routine and have seen improvements in my strength, power, endurance, and balance. I love how I can use it for squats, pulls, overhead throws, and rotational training. No two workouts are the same, and I never get bored!

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. First, the price point might be a barrier for some people starting their kettlebell collection. Second, since kettlebell training requires proper technique and understanding of the movements, beginners may need to invest time into learning these skills to avoid injury.

In conclusion, the Body Solid Kettlebell has been a fantastic addition to my home gym. Its quality construction, versatility, and ability to enhance various aspects of my fitness have made it a go-to piece of equipment in my training sessions.

### [36kg Cast Iron Powder Coated Kettlebell (80lb)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="cast-iron-powder-coated-kettlebell-36kg-80lb-size-36-kg-79-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cast-iron-powder-coated-kettlebell-36kg-80lb-size-36-kg-79-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently incorporated the 36kg Gorilla Kettlebell into my workout routine and it's been a game-changer. The powder-coated surface provides a reliable grip, even when my hands are sweat-soaked during intense workouts. The single-cast construction lends a sturdy and lasting quality to the kettlebell, giving me peace of mind knowing that it's built to last.

One thing that I particularly appreciated was the color-coded weight indicators on the handles. It made it incredibly easy to identify and grab the weight I needed without any confusion. Plus, having both KG and LB marked on the kettlebell was a nice touch, catering to both metric and imperial system users.

However, one minor drawback is the weight difference between the advertised 36kg and the actual 32kg. Despite this, it's still a substantial and effective weight for my strength-training needs. All in all, the Gorilla Kettlebell has become a valuable addition to my home gym, making my workouts more dynamic and challenging.

### [Stamina Adjustable Kettle Versa-Bell for Customized Strength Training](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

### [Blogilates Coral Pink 15lb Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

Now, onto the not-so-great parts. Some reviewers mentioned receiving dirty or scratched kettlebells. However, I didn't encounter any issues like that. My kettlebell arrived in pristine condition, so I'm not sure what others experienced. Additionally, I noticed that the color is slightly different than what's shown online. It leans more towards mauve than the bright pink shown in the pictures.

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Blogilates Iron Kettlebell in Coral Pink 15lbs. It's stylish, effective, and has truly transformed my workout routine. If you're looking for a high-quality kettlebell that will make your workouts more enjoyable, look no further!

### [45lb Body-Solid Premium Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="body-solid-45lb-premium-kettlebell-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-45lb-premium-kettlebell-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the day I brought home my first set of Body Solid Premium Kettlebells. At first, I wasn't sure how to use them, but after some research and practice, they quickly became an essential part of my workout routine. What I love about these kettlebells is how easy they are to read - their weight reference is clear and concise, making it easy for me to track my progress.

The chrome handles on these weights are another standout feature. They're comfortable to grip and make even the most intense workouts feel manageable. Plus, the handles on heavier kettlebells are large enough to fit both of my hands, allowing me to lift more weight without worrying about dropping it.

However, one downside I've noticed is that these kettlebells don't come with any kind of protective coating, which means that over time, they can develop small chips and dings. While this doesn't affect their performance, it does make them look a little worn.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a versatile piece of workout equipment that's easy to use and can help you build strength, power, endurance, and balance, then the Body Solid Premium Kettlebells are definitely worth considering.

### [GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg) and I've been loving it in my home gym. This kettlebell is different from the usual solid ones as it's filled with sand which gives it a unique feel. The sand adjustment is super cool; you can adjust the weight by adding or removing sand. I must say, the sand makes the swings feel more real and dynamic, quite similar to using a sandbag for exercises. Plus, the ability to travel with an empty kettlebell and fill it up when needed is a huge convenience factor.

The construction of the kettlebell is top-notch. It's made of 1000D Cordura, double-pass stitched, and has a neoprene-padded handle. Even after regular use, it still looks and feels brand new. The only downside I found was that the handle tends to get a bit slippery when your hands get sweaty, but that's a common issue with all kettlebells, not just this one.

In terms of performance, the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell does a fantastic job. The shifting weight of the sand during exercises helps engage more muscle groups, making my workouts more intense and effective. The kettlebell handle is comfortable to grip and the range of motion in swings and lifts feels natural.

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. The GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg) is a high-quality, unique piece of workout equipment that has definitely enhanced my home gym experience. If you're looking for a versatile kettlebell that offers adjustable weight and great performance, this one is definitely worth considering.
