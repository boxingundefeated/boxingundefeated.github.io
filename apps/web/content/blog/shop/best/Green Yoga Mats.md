### [Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat, Cool Mint](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a devout yogi for a while now, and I must say my journey to finding the perfect yoga mat has taken me through several models. [This Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat has been quite transformative in my practice.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) The first thing that caught my eye was its lightweight, portable design. I'm someone who likes to take my yoga sessions on-the-go, so this feature was a major selling point for me.

What really stood out was the "sticky" textured surface. When I'm in a downward dog position, I want to be sure I'm not sliding all over the place. This mat provided an excellent grip, allowing me to maintain my poses without losing balance.

However, it's not all peaches and roses. While the mat has a certain thickness and cushioning that's comforting during some poses, I've found that it could be improved to provide more support during activities like sit-ups or crunches. Its 5mm thickness might not be enough for those looking for enhanced support during these exercises.

In conclusion, I would recommend the Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a lightweight, portable mat with an effective grip. However, if you're primarily focused on activities that require more support, such as abdominal workouts, you might want to consider a thicker mat.

Remember, personal experiences with a product can vary. So, while some users might find the odor upon unpacking a deterrent, I personally didn't find it too bothersome after airing out the mat for a couple of days as suggested in the accompanying instructions. Each yogi’s needs are unique, so it’s important to evaluate your personal preferences and requirements before making a purchase.

### [Green Extra Thick Yoga Mat Set with Knee Pad](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-1-2-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-and-kne-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-1-2-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-and-kne-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Balancefrom GoYoga+ All-Purpose 1/2-Inch Extra Thick High Density Anti-Tear Exercise Yoga Mat and Knee Pad with Carrying Strap in a lovely shade of green. Right out of the box, the first thing that struck me about this yoga mat was its thickness. At 1/2-inch, it provides ample cushioning for my joints and added comfort during practice.

Pairing it with the knee pad has been a game-changer, especially when I'm doing poses that require extended periods on my knees or elbows. The double-sided non-slip surface ensures a secure grip, reducing the risk of injuries and making every session more enjoyable.

Now, onto the highlights. The carrying strap included in this package is not just any ordinary strap; it's adjustable, allowing me to customize it according to my convenience. This feature, combined with its light weight, makes it incredibly easy to transport and store.

However, no product is perfect. While the moisture-resistant technology does make cleaning the mat a breeze, I did find that the product had a slight odor initially. Thankfully, after a few uses, the smell faded away.

In conclusion, I would recommend the Balancefrom GoYoga+ Exercise Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a comfortable, versatile, and secure addition to their yoga practice.

### [Green Wai Lana Yoga & Pilates Mat for Extra Comfort and Grip](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I never thought I'd be someone who does yoga, but when I got my hands on the WAI Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat in green, it was a game-changer. It's thick, making it super comfortable, especially during those difficult poses. The extra grip is amazing, no slip and slide for me. Plus, it's light and earth-friendly, something I really appreciate. It's become my go-to mat for yoga and Pilates, definitely worth every penny.

However, one small issue I've noticed is that it's slightly wider than my usual mat. I mean, it's not a deal-breaker, but it can feel a bit overwhelming at times. But, overall, I absolutely adore this mat!

### [Green 1-Inch Extra Thick Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="balancefrom-gocloud-all-purpose-1-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-car-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-gocloud-all-purpose-1-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-car-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know that perfect yoga mat you've been searching for? Well, I found it. The BalanceFrom GoCloud All-Purpose Yoga Mat is a game-changer.

I'm not exaggerating when I say this mat has transformed my workout routine. The extra thickness provides unrivaled comfort and support, even during my most intense sessions. I don't have to worry about my joints taking a beating anymore.

The anti-tear surface is no joke either. It's held up against my many falls and missteps, and it's still in great shape. Plus, the non-slip surface guarantees safety every time I step onto it.

One of the best things about this mat is its ease of maintenance. A quick wipe with soap and water does the trick, leaving it as good as new. And speaking of clean, the absence of any unpleasant odors is a breath of fresh air.

The carrying strap is another added bonus. It makes transporting and storing the mat a breeze. I can now take my workout anywhere, whether it's to the park, beach, or gym.

Now, let's talk about the few things that could be better. The strap could be a bit sturdier, but it does the job. Another minor issue is that the mat can roll up unevenly when not properly rolled, but again, not a deal-breaker.

In summary, this BalanceFrom GoCloud All-Purpose Yoga Mat is a must-have for anyone looking to up their fitness game. Its comfort, durability, and ease of use make it a standout choice among other mats on the market. Oh, and the lightweight design? It's the cherry on top!

### [Green Sol Living Ultra-Comfort Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="sol-living-premium-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sol-living-premium-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the Sol Living Premium Natural Rubber Yoga Mat in green, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my yoga practice. Its eco-friendly composition of natural tree rubber provides an incredibly smooth surface that's both comfortable and firm. This natural rubber mat also boasts excellent grip, eliminating any concerns about sliding or losing balance during tough poses.

One of the standout features of this yoga mat is its larger size, measuring 24 inches by 72 inches. This extra space has been a godsend for me as it accommodates my tall frame better than most standard-sized mats. I've found it equally suitable for other styles of yoga, such as Kundalini, Vinyasa, Bikram, and Ashtanga.

The Sol Living yoga mat is incredibly easy to maintain and clean, thanks to its natural rubber material. This lightweight, portable mat has become my go-to option for on-the-go yogis, as it weighs only 2.5 pounds and rolls up neatly for easy storage.

However, there are a few downsides to this mat. Firstly, it does have a slight rubber scent when first unpacking it. While this has diminished over time, some users may find it unpleasant. Secondly, the natural rubber material can make the mat a little heavier than synthetic alternatives, which could be an issue for those looking for a more lightweight option.

In conclusion, the Sol Living Premium Natural Rubber Yoga Mat has been a fantastic addition to my yoga practice. Its superior grip, durability, and larger size make it an excellent choice for both men and women. Though it may have a minor rubber odor and be slightly heavier than synthetic mats, these are minor drawbacks that do not detract from its overall effectiveness and comfort as a high-quality yoga mat.

### [All in Motion Green Cork Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="all-in-motion-natural-cork-tpe-5mm-green-yoga-mat-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/all-in-motion-natural-cork-tpe-5mm-green-yoga-mat-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the All in Motion Natural Cork TPE Yoga Mat, and it has quickly become my go-to for all my workout sessions. As a yoga enthusiast, I was intrigued by the cork material, which offers not only natural aesthetics but also a comfortable and secure surface for different poses.

The first thing that caught my eye about this mat is its non-slip texture. The grip it provides is exceptional, especially when I get sweaty during intense yoga sessions. The cork absorbs moisture, preventing it from becoming slippery and ensuring my stability throughout the workout.

Another feature I appreciate is the cushioning. While it's not the softest mat out there, the 5mm thickness provides enough padding to support my knees and joints during various poses. I find this perfect for yoga as well as other floor-based exercises like Pilates, which require a balance between comfort and stability.

However, there are a few cons to consider. The mat's rigidity makes it slightly challenging to roll up smoothly for storage. Additionally, the cork side tends to absorb dust and dirt more readily than other mats, requiring regular cleaning to maintain its appearance.

Overall, the All in Motion Natural Cork TPE Yoga Mat has proven to be an excellent addition to my workout routine. Its superior grip, comfortable cushioning, and natural materials make it stand out from many of its competitors, offering a reliable option for those seeking stability and support during their practice.

### [Celestial Printed 5mm Yoga Mat with Green Design](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-celestial-green-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-celestial-green-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Gaiam Celestial Green Yoga Mat for a few months now, and I must say, it's become an integral part of my daily yoga routine. As a yoga enthusiast, I highly value comfort, stability, and eco-friendliness when it comes to my practice. This mat provides all of that and more.

Firstly, the cushioning is superb. It's thick enough to provide ample support for my knees and joints, but not too bulky that it gets in the way during poses. The non-slip surface is another plus point. Even when I'm in down dog position and my hands are slightly sweaty, I don't find myself sliding all over the place. It's a relief to have such a reliable mat to rely on.

However, I mustn't ignore the minor downsides. As much as I love the vibrant color and patterns of the mat, they seem to attract dust and dirt quite easily. Additionally, some users have reported issues with slipperiness after prolonged use. While this hasn't been a problem for me personally, it could be worth considering if you tend to sweat heavily during workout sessions.

In conclusion, the Gaiam Celestial Green Yoga Mat has been a great addition to my home workout space. Its comfortable cushioning, non-slip surface, and attractive design make it a strong contender in the world of yoga mats. Despite a few minor shortcomings, I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish yoga mat.

### [Eco-Friendly Yogi Mat: Free from Phthalates](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats"><img alt="wai-lana-non-phthalate-yogi-mat-apple-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wai-lana-non-phthalate-yogi-mat-apple-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the WAI Lana Non-Phthalate Yogi Mat in a lovely apple green color. As an avid yoga enthusiast, I was excited to try this mat due to its eco- and health-friendliness, as it's free from harmful chemicals like phthalates, phenols, dioxins, and furans.

First off, the traction on this mat is superb. It offers a great grip, making me feel safe and stable throughout my yoga practice. Its thickness provides just the right amount of cushioning for added comfort and support in those challenging poses.

However, one downside might be its size - measuring 0.12"Hx 24"Wx 68"L, it isn't as portable as some might prefer. But overall, this yoga mat has been a delight to use, and I'm happy with its quality, durability, and craftsmanship.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a colorful, comfortable, and high-performance yoga mat that's also good for the environment, the WAI Lana Non-Phthalate Yogi Mat is definitely worth considering.
