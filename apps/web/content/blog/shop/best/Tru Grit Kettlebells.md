But it's not all sunshine and roses. There were a couple of instances where the kettlebell chipped or flaked during shipping, which was a bit disappointing. I guess that's just part of buying things online, though.

Despite that, the solid cast iron construction has proven to be incredibly durable, lasting through countless workouts without any signs of wear or tear. Plus, with weights ranging from 10 pounds to 25 pounds, there's something for everyone no matter what your fitness goals are.

My cast iron kettlebell has been a game-changer in my workout routine. At first, I was skeptical about purchasing it due to the weight, but its powder-coated surface provides a textured grip that makes even the toughest workout sessions manageable.

One of my favorite features is the color weight indicators on the handle, making it incredibly easy to identify each kettlebell in my collection. Its single cast construction offers unmatched durability, giving me peace of mind knowing that my investment will last for years to come.

However, there is a slight drawback. Due to its heavyweight, I sometimes find it challenging to perform certain exercises without additional support or assistance. Overall, I'm thrilled with this 20kg kettlebell, and it has become an integral part of my fitness journey.

One of the highlights of this kettlebell is its durability. The high-quality cast iron ensures it can withstand heavy usage without breaking down or losing its shape. The color-coded handles make it easy to identify the weight quickly, which is a huge plus when I'm in the middle of a workout and don't have time to fumble around.

However, there are some cons to consider. The cardboard packaging used during shipping isn't the sturdiest, and I've had a couple of kettlebells arrive with minor dents. Additionally, the handle could be smoother, as I've noticed that my hands get a bit chafed after extended use.

Overall, the Tru Grit Cast Iron Kettlebell has been a reliable workout companion. Its durability and comfortable grip make it an excellent choice for both gym and home use.

[All in all, I would recommend the All in Motion kettlebell to anyone looking to enhance their home workout experience.](https://best.serp.co/shop/onnit-kettlebells/) Its combination of functionality, style, and ease of use makes it a valuable addition to any fitness collection.

### [GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/tru-grit-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/tru-grit-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg) and I've been loving it in my home gym. This kettlebell is different from the usual solid ones as it's filled with sand which gives it a unique feel. The sand adjustment is super cool; you can adjust the weight by adding or removing sand. I must say, the sand makes the swings feel more real and dynamic, quite similar to using a sandbag for exercises. Plus, the ability to travel with an empty kettlebell and fill it up when needed is a huge convenience factor.

The construction of the kettlebell is top-notch. It's made of 1000D Cordura, double-pass stitched, and has a neoprene-padded handle. Even after regular use, it still looks and feels brand new. The only downside I found was that the handle tends to get a bit slippery when your hands get sweaty, but that's a common issue with all kettlebells, not just this one.

In terms of performance, the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell does a fantastic job. The shifting weight of the sand during exercises helps engage more muscle groups, making my workouts more intense and effective. The kettlebell handle is comfortable to grip and the range of motion in swings and lifts feels natural.

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. The GORUCK Sand Kettlebell - 18lb (8kg) is a high-quality, unique piece of workout equipment that has definitely enhanced my home gym experience. If you're looking for a versatile kettlebell that offers adjustable weight and great performance, this one is definitely worth considering.
