<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/tumbler-water-bottles"><img alt="cirkul-32oz-matte-black-stainless-steel-water-bottle-starter-kit-with-black-lid-and-2-flavor-cartrid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cirkul-32oz-matte-black-stainless-steel-water-bottle-starter-kit-with-black-lid-and-2-flavor-cartrid-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Cirkul 32oz Matte Black Stainless Steel Water Bottle Starter Kit, and I must say; it's been a game-changer in my daily hydration routine. The kit comes with a sleek, 32oz stainless steel bottle, a black comfort grip lid, and two flavor cartridges - Blueberry Grape and Kiwi Berry.

The real star of this kit is the bottle itself. Its smooth matte black finish adds a touch of elegance to my daily routine. I was particularly impressed by its excellent insulation capabilities. I've filled it with ice-cold water in the morning, and thanks to its double-wall vacuum seal, the water has stayed chilled throughout the day.

The included flavor cartridges have been a pleasant addition. Having the option to infuse my regular water with appealing flavors like Blueberry Grape and Kiwi Berry has significantly increased my water intake. The convenience of being able to add a dash of flavor to my water with just a squeeze of the cartridge is quite refreshing.

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the bottle has a slightly wider mouth compared to some other water bottles I've used. While this hasn't been a major issue, it does take a little getting used to. Secondly, the lid's seal isn't as effective as I would have liked. Occasionally, I've noticed a little leakage, which can be a tad inconvenient.

Overall, if you're looking for a stylish, convenient water bottle that keeps your water icy cold, the Cirkul 32oz Matte Black Stainless Steel Water Bottle Starter Kit is worth a try. With its appealing flavors and excellent insulation, it's been a refreshing addition to my daily routine.

As I unloaded the tumbler from its box, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I was holding a piece of quality craftsmanship.

One feature that truly stood out for me was its double-wall vacuum insulation. This innovative design managed to keep my coffee hot for hours, even when left in the harsh winter chill outside. And let's not forget about the cold drinks; the Stanley tumbler was equally proficient at keeping them icy and refreshing.

Another aspect that I absolutely loved was the FlowState three-position lid with rotating cover and reusable straw. Not only did this ensure a leak-proof seal, but it also made sipping my drinks a joyful experience. And when the lid was closed, there was no disturbance from unwanted environmental noises.

However, nothing in life is perfect, and the Stanley tumbler had its fair share of minor drawbacks.

It took me a little more effort than I would have liked, but it was manageable overall.

The screw-on, 3-position lid is another standout feature. The rotating cover provides three different options for drinking, including a straw opening for those hot summer days and a full-cover top to prevent spills while on the move. Plus, the reusable straw is a nice touch, cutting down on waste and making it easy to sip on my favorite beverages.

One minor drawback is that the base diameter is quite large, which might make it difficult to fit in some cup holders. However, the overall design and insulation capabilities more than make up for this minor inconvenience.

However, there are some downsides. The lid and straw aren't recommended for hot beverages, which can be a little inconvenient. Additionally, the lid has a knack for creating a vacuum when using the straw, which sucks up ice into a clump near the opening.
