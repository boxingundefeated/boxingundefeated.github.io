### [AIREX Calyana Prime Yoga Mat, 26" x 73" x 0.2](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats"><img alt="airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a frequent user of the AIREX Calyana Yoga Mat for a while now, and I must say, it's quickly become my go-to mat for all my yoga and fitness needs. It's not just incredibly comfortable with its soft, non-slip surface, but also incredibly durable. The transverse ribbing pattern provides exceptional tear resistance, making it ideal for indoor and outdoor use alike.

One feature that particularly stood out for me is its portability. Weighing just over 5 lbs. , it's super lightweight and easy to move around, so I can take it with me wherever I go. I also appreciate how spacious it is; perfect for all forms of exercise.

However, there are a couple of minor cons. Firstly, the mat can be a bit heavy for some, especially if you don't have much upper body strength. Secondly, while the grip is good overall, it might not be sticky enough for some intense, sweat-inducing workouts.

All in all, I absolutely love the AIREX Calyana Yoga Mat. It's durable, comfortable, and versatile - everything one could ask for in a yoga mat!

### [Solana Comfort 1/2-inch Thick Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats"><img alt="retrospec-solana-yoga-mat-in-violet-haze-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/retrospec-solana-yoga-mat-in-violet-haze-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Retrospec Solana Yoga Mat in Violet Haze, and I've been thoroughly impressed by its comfortable thick material and non-slip surface. It has genuinely made my yoga sessions more enjoyable by reducing pain on problem areas like joints, neck, back, and knees.

The highlight of this yoga mat is undoubtedly its thickness. At a hefty 1/2" thick, the Solana provides ample cushioning for my knees, hips, and hands without sacrificing balance. The textured surface also ensures a firm grip during my practice, even on slick floors.

However, I did notice that the mat tends to release a mild odor, possibly due to its newness. I've aired it out for a few days, and the smell has started to dissipate. Additionally, the strap included for easy carriage isn't the most durable, but it doesn't detract from the overall performance of the mat.

In conclusion, the Retrospec Solana Yoga Mat in Violet Haze is a fantastic choice for those seeking comfort and stability during their yoga routine. The thick, cushy material offers support to problem areas while its non-slip surface ensures safety and balance. Plus, the easy-to-clean feature is an added bonus! While the initial odor and the not-so-durable strap may be minor drawbacks, these do not outweigh the benefits that this yoga mat provides.

### [Purple Mandala Non-Slip Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-mandala-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-mandala-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[I recently decided to take up yoga to relax and unwind after a long day in my high-stress job, so I bought the Gaiam 5mm Purple Mandala Yoga Mat.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) After weeks of using this mat, I can say it's definitely improved my practice, offering both style and comfort.

Firstly, the design is simply stunning. The mandala pattern is aesthetically pleasing and beautifully intricate, making it a joy to use every day. It adds an element of mindfulness and tranquillity to my practice, helping me find my center during those longer, harder poses.

But it's not just about looks, it's also very comfortable to use. The 5mm thickness provides just the right amount of cushioning, supporting my joints without compromising stability. In fact, I find I can stay in poses longer without feeling discomfort or strain on my knees.

However, one issue I did encounter was its slipperiness at first. But a quick wash with a 50/50 mixture of water and vinegar fixed that, making it much more secure underfoot.

Another minor drawback is that it doesn't come with a strap, which would have been a nice addition for portability purposes. Nonetheless, overall, this mat has been a great addition to my yoga practice, providing both comfort and style. It's definitely one of my favorite purchases and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

### [Gaiam Performance 5mm Dry-Grip Yoga Mat (Purple)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-performance-dry-grip-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-performance-dry-grip-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Performance Dry-Grip Yoga Mat in my practice for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been an impressive companion. The topcoat is incredibly effective in wicking away moisture, providing a better grip as the temperature rises in the yoga studio. I found this to be particularly useful during hot yoga sessions where others might struggle with slippery mats.

The dry-grip technology truly delivers on its promise, keeping me secure and focused on my practice rather than worrying about losing my balance due to a slippery surface. Another standout feature is the PVC material. This isn't just about the eco-friendliness or the fact that it's safe for those with latex sensitivities; it also means the mat seals out germs, odours, and bacteria, making it a hygienic choice for shared spaces or communal classes.

However, one downside I've noticed is its lack of durability. After consistent use over a period of time, the surface tends to wear off faster than expected, leaving purple dust on my hands, knees, and feet. This isn't just unsightly but could potentially cause staining on light-coloured clothing if not cleaned properly.

Moreover, the weight of the mat can be an issue for some users. If portability is a priority for you, this may not be the most convenient option as it's a bit on the heavier side. All things considered, however, this mat has significantly enhanced my practice, providing support, comfort, and security across various postures.

In conclusion, while it may have some drawbacks, the Gaiam Performance Dry-Grip Yoga Mat has overall been a reliable and beneficial addition to my daily yoga routine.

### [Yoga Mat, Purple - Lightweight, Durable, Non-Slip](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats"><img alt="ss-tapas-yoga-mat-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ss-tapas-yoga-mat-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'll share a little story about how I got the most out of my S&S Tapas Yoga Mat, Purple. As an avid yoga practitioner, I used to struggle with mats that either didn't stick well to the floor or had the habit of stretching out during use. Not to mention the hassle of storing them properly. Once I got my hands on this mat, all those issues were a thing of the past.

The mat offers a stable, non-slip surface that doesn't budge even during intense yoga sessions. Notably, the material hasn't stretched out, despite regular usage. Its lightweight and durable design makes it easy to roll up and store. Plus, the included strap adds to its portability and convenience.

However, not everything is smooth sailing. Due to its foam PVC (vinyl) construction, it's advisable to clean it with soap and water only, avoiding harsh cleaning solutions. As for its dimensions, some may find it a bit too long or wide for their taste. But overall, the S&S Tapas Yoga Mat, Purple has been a game-changer for my yoga practice. It's comfortable, reliable, and easy to store and transport.

### [Classic 1/8 Inch Purple Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats)

Its lightweight design and super sticky surface make it a dream for travel, while its latex-free durable foam offers a cushioned yet firm surface for a comfortable practice, whether I'm indoors or out. .

Overall, the Yoga Direct Standard Yoga Mat has been a game-changer for my practice, offering both comfort and style. .
