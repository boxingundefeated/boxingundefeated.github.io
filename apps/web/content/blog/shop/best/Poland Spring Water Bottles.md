### [16.9 oz Naturally Balanced Alkaline Water Bottles – Icelandic Glacial](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/poland-spring-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/poland-spring-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="icelandic-glacial-natural-spring-water-6-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/icelandic-glacial-natural-spring-water-6-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a self-proclaimed water snob, I've tried numerous bottled waters over the years. However, my search for the perfect hydration companion ended when I stumbled upon Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water. Born and bottled in the land of fire and ice, this water is not only incredibly pure but also offers a uniquely refreshing taste.

What sets Icelandic Glacial apart from other bottled waters is its natural balance. Extracted from a volcanically-formed spring that has remained untouched for over 5,000 years, it's no wonder this water tastes so clean and crisp. Additionally, it's free of heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other impurities, making it one of the safest and most environmentally-friendly options available.

One feature that really impresses me is the high alkaline pH level of 8.4. This gives the water a slightly sweet aftertaste, which I find quite enjoyable and thirst-quenching. [In terms of taste and quality, Icelandic Glacial reigns supreme among my daily drinkers.](https://gist.github.com/bestappsandcodereviews5/05946b3fee641e662d36c6143a38ea91)

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the bottles and boxes are made from recycled materials which, while eco-friendly, can sometimes arrive damaged due to improper packaging. Secondly, this product can be difficult to find in stores, often forcing me to order it online.

Despite these minor issues, I wholeheartedly recommend Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water to anyone seeking an exceptional bottled water experience. Its impeccable taste, purity, and high alkaline pH make it stand out from the competition. So go ahead, give your taste buds a treat and join me on my quest to stay hydrated with the world's finest water.
