### [Simple Modern Ascent 24 oz Water Bottle with Straw Lid](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cirkul-stainless-steel-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cirkul-stainless-steel-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="simple-modern-ascent-water-bottle-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-bottle-24-fl-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/simple-modern-ascent-water-bottle-straw-lid-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-bottle-24-fl-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Simple Modern Ascent Water Bottle, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. This 24-ounce bottle not only looks sleek and stylish but also keeps my water ice-cold for up to 24 hours - perfect for those scorching summer days!

One of the things I love about this bottle is its straw lid. It's leakproof when closed and super easy to clean on the top rack of the dishwasher. However, I must admit that it's not meant for hot or carbonated liquids as pressure buildup can cause leaks or spills. But hey, who needs coffee when you've got ice-cold water to perk you up?

Another standout feature is its cupholder-friendly design. I can easily fit it in my car's cupholder, making it convenient for long drives or road trips. Plus, its reusable nature helps me reduce plastic waste, making it an eco-friendly choice.

Now let's talk about some downsides. The narrow opening at the top makes it a bit difficult to clean with a regular [bottle brush](https://best.serp.co/shop/bottle-brush/), but using a smaller brush does the trick. Also, the straw occasionally sucks in air along with water, which can be a bit annoying at times. But overall, these minor issues are overshadowed by the benefits of having a reliable and stylish water bottle.

In conclusion, the Simple Modern Ascent Water Bottle with strawBottle with straw lid has become my go-to choice for staying hydrated throughout the day. Its impressive insulation capabilities, leakproof straw lid, and cupholder-friendly design make it a perfect companion for both indoor and outdoor adventures. So why settle for lukewarm water when you can have ice-cold refreshment on-the-go?

The kit comes with a sleek, 32oz stainless steel bottle, a black comfort grip lid, and two flavor cartridges - Blueberry Grape and Kiwi Berry.

The real star of this kit is the bottle itself. Its smooth matte black finish adds a touch of elegance to my daily routine. I was particularly impressed by its excellent insulation capabilities. I've filled it with ice-cold water in the morning, and thanks to its double-wall vacuum seal, the water has stayed chilled throughout the day.

The included flavor cartridges have been a pleasant addition. Having the option to infuse my regular water with appealing flavors like Blueberry Grape and Kiwi Berry has significantly increased my water intake. The convenience of being able to add a dash of flavor to my water with just a squeeze of the cartridge is quite refreshing.

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the bottle has a slightly wider mouth compared to some other water bottles I've used. While this hasn't been a major issue, it does take a little getting used to. Secondly, the lid's seal isn't as effective as I would have liked. Occasionally, I've noticed a little leakage, which can be a tad inconvenient.

Overall, if you're looking for a stylish, convenient water bottle that keeps your water icy cold, the Cirkul 32oz Matte Black Stainless Steel Water Bottle Starter Kit is worth a try. With its appealing flavors and excellent insulation, it's been a refreshing addition to my daily routine.
