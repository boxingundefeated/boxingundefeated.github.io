As someone who's been using the New Balance 19" [Laptop Backpack](https://best.serp.co/shop/laptop-backpack/), I can attest to its perfect blend of style, comfort, and functionality. I was pleasantly surprised by how it's held up over time, despite its daily use. The 100% polyester material is incredibly durable and resistant to wear and tear, which has been a godsend with the amount of stuff I carry around.

One feature that really stood out for me was the padded [laptop sleeve](https://best.serp.co/shop/laptop-sleeve/). It's roomy enough to fit my 15-inch laptop comfortably, offering excellent protection from bumps and scratches. Plus, the polyester lining provides an added layer of security, making sure my valuables stay safe and sound.

The only downside I found with this backpack is that it's hand wash only. While this is understandable given its materials, it does make maintenance a bit more challenging. However, the overall quality and performance of the New Balance 19" Laptop Backpack more than make up for this minor inconvenience. [I give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, stylish, and functional backpack.](https://best.serp.co/shop/fjallraven-hiking-backpacks/)

### [Spacious and Durable New Balance Team Duffel Bag - Perfect for Fitness and Training](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/new-balance-gym-bag?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

I've been a gym rat for years now, and the New Balance Lab13510 Team Large Duffel has been my trusty companion on countless workout sessions. The moment I saw it, I knew it was perfect - spacious, sturdy, and stylish, just what I needed to carry my stuff.

But the best part? That spacious, zipped inner compartment that can hold all my gym essentials, from sneakers to a towel. And the smaller, zipped side pockets? They're like little helpers that keep my keys and phone within easy reach. Plus, the top handles with Velcro fasteners and the adjustable strap with foam grip make it super comfortable and easy to carry around.

However, I have to say the labelling on the outside could be a bit clearer. I've had a few instances where I had to dig around to find what I was looking for. But hey, no product is perfect, right? Overall, the New Balance Lab13510 Team Large Duffel has been a game-changer for me and my workout routine. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, spacious gym bag.

### [New Balance OPP Core Small Duffel - Black for Gym & Travel](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/new-balance-gym-bag?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/new-balance-gym-bag?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="new-balance-opp-core-small-duffel-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-opp-core-small-duffel-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the New Balance OPP Core Small Duffel in black, and I'm happy to share my experience with this stylish and functional gym bag. At first glance, the Flying logo on the front caught my eye, showcasing the brand's identity in a subtle yet bold manner. The unlined main compartment allows for easy access to your essentials, making it a breeze to pack and unpack your belongings.

The Jacquard webbings strap and plain double handles offer a comfortable grip and added durability, ensuring that this bag can withstand even the toughest of workouts or commutes. Its dimensions (10.6 in H x 16.9 in W x 9.8 in D) make it an ideal choice for those seeking a compact yet spacious solution for their on-the-go needs.

However, there's one cautionary detail I'd like to share - the weight of the bag itself is quite heavy at. 52 lbs. Although it's not a deal-breaker, it's something to keep in mind when considering this option.

In summary, the New Balance OPP Core Small Duffel is a stylish and practical choice for those seeking a reliable gym bag or travel companion. It boasts a sleek design with quality craftsmanship, while also offering easy access to your belongings. The only downside is its weight, but overall, it's a worthwhile investment in my book.

### [All Terrain New Balance Gym Bag](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/new-balance-gym-bag?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/new-balance-gym-bag?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="new-balance-terrain-bungee-backpack-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-terrain-bungee-backpack-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the New Balance Terrain Bungee Backpack in black, and boy, has it been a game-changer for my daily commute! The polyester material is sturdy and weather-resistant, which means my belongings stay safe and dry no matter where I go. The adjustable strap ensures a perfect fit on my shoulders, making it incredibly comfortable to carry around even when I've got a lot of stuff in there. I've been using it as my go-to gym bag, and I'm impressed with how well it holds up to rigorous use.

However, one thing I found slightly disappointing was that the weight capacity tops off at 25 lbs. While that's enough for most of what I carry, I do wonder if I'll need an upgrade once I start packing more gear for extended trips. Overall, I'm thrilled with the New Balance Terrain Bungee Backpack - it's stylish, durable, and perfect for anyone on the go who appreciates both comfort and craftsmanship.

One thing that took me by surprise was how lightweight and compact it is. Its dimensions are impressive, fitting all my stuff without making me look like I'm about to go on a month-long expedition. Additionally, the water-resistant bottom panel gives extra protection, which is always a bonus.

However, there's one downside to this bag - its color. I wish the "black" version was actually more black than greyish-blue. Nonetheless, this little issue doesn't take away from the overall superior quality of the bag.

All in all, I'm really happy with my New Balance Core Performance Medium Duffel. Not only does it have ample storage options and excellent craftsmanship, but it has also become my go-to bag for travel and sports practices. Highly recommended!

It's made of high-quality polyester, so I know it's built to last.

On the downside, the bulky design can be a little cumbersome at times, but that's a small price to pay for such a versatile and stylish bag. Overall, I would highly recommend the New Balance Cord Backpack to anyone in need of a reliable and stylish day-to-day bag.
