### [Jade Voyager Foldable Yoga Mat in Olive Green](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-voyager-yoga-mat-olive-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-voyager-yoga-mat-olive-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Jade Voyager Yoga Mat in olive green color, and I must say it has become a staple in my yoga routine! This mat is incredibly lightweight and foldable, making it perfect for yogis on the go or those who like a closer connection to the ground. It's super easy to clean with soap and water, and the natural rubber material ensures optimal support even when I'm sweating it out.

One of the things I love most about this mat is its exceptional grip. I've practiced yoga for several years now, and I've never encountered a mat that holds my feet and hands in place as firmly as the Jade Voyager. Plus, its eco-friendliness is an added bonus - knowing that my yoga practice is contributing to a greener environment gives me a sense of satisfaction.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this mat. Firstly, since it's so thin, you may need another mat underneath if you have sensitive knees. Secondly, it does have a slight rubber smell when new, which can be somewhat off-putting. Lastly, the creases formed from folding the mat might take a little time to smooth out completely.

In conclusion, the Jade Voyager Yoga Mat is a fantastic option for travelers and those looking for a minimalistic yoga experience. Its lightweight design, excellent grip, and eco-friendly nature make it stand out in the world of yoga mats. While it may not be perfect for everyone due to its thinness and rubber odor, it's definitely worth considering if you need a portable, reliable option.

### [Jade Yoga Harmony Premium Non-Slip Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried numerous mats over the years to find the perfect one. The Jade Harmony Yoga Mat, Midnight Blue, has been the best I've come across yet. Its 3/16" thickness provides just the right balance of cushion and traction. Made from natural rubber, it has an open cell structure that eliminates issues with slipping during sweaty sessions. The build quality is exceptional, boasting resilience and resistance to compression. Cleaning is a breeze, as it can be easily washed with warm water and soap, air-dried outside or flat-dried indoors.

One of the standout features of the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat is its eco-friendliness. It contains no PVC or ozone-depleting substances, making it an environmentally responsible choice. However, this does come with a trade-off - a potent rubber smell that may be off-putting to some users. This can be reduced by airing out the mat before use and wiping it down with a solution of water and vinegar.

Despite its thickness, the mat is portable and can be carried safely to and from classes. The stickiness of the mat provides excellent grip, preventing any sliding or loss of footing during practice. However, this stickiness can be a double-edged sword. Some users may find it challenging to transition between poses smoothly due to the sticky surface.

In my experience, the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat has been a reliable and comfortable companion throughout my yoga journey. Its thick cushioning has been a boon for my knees during certain poses, providing the support and comfort I need. Additionally, the mat's non-slip surface has helped me maintain my balance and focus during practice.

However, it's worth mentioning that the initial rubber smell can be quite strong. If you have a sensitive nose, be prepared for a few days of adjustment before the smell dissipates. Furthermore, the stickiness of the mat may require some getting used to, especially when transitioning between poses.

In conclusion, the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat has been a game-changer for my yoga practice. Its high-quality materials, eco-friendliness, and excellent grip make it a top choice for both beginners and advanced yogis. Despite its rubber smell and sticky surface, the benefits it offers far outweigh any drawbacks. If you're looking for a premium yoga mat that delivers on performance and comfort, the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat is definitely worth considering.

### [Reversible Jade Salutation Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I roll out my Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat (6mm), I'm greeted with a vibrant display of celestial-inspired patterns that instantly brighten up my yoga space. The thick PVC material offers a cushioned surface, making my practice more comfortable, especially on hardfloor surfaces. The non-slip texture keeps me grounded through even the most challenging poses, while also ensuring I stay securely in place.

The two-sided design adds a touch of personalization, allowing me to express my yoga mood by choosing between the sun or moon side. The extra thickness provides much-needed support for my joints, making it a perfect fit for those with sensitive knees.

However, one issue I noticed is that it does have a distinct new product smell when first opened. But, as many users have suggested, airing it out for a few days before use helps eliminate this odor quite effectively. Some users have also mentioned experiencing initial stickiness issues, which can be resolved by wiping the mat with a damp cloth and giving it time to dry before usage.

[Overall, the Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat (6mm) lives up to its reputation as a high-quality and comfortable yoga mat.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) Its durable construction, non-slip surface, and appealing aesthetics make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced yogis alike.

### [Jade Mysore Yoga Rug - Natural Cotton & Plant Dyes](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My journey with the Jade Yoga Rug Black has been quite an adventure. As a yoga enthusiast, I was excited to try this natural, organic cotton mat. Upon receiving it, I was impressed by its size (27" x 72") and weight (2.5 lbs), making it easy to carry around to various classes or even take it outdoors for a beach yoga session.

One feature that stood out was the rug's machine washability, a big plus because some mats can be quite difficult to clean. But remember to wash colors separately in cold water and hang them to dry as they may shrink in the wash.

Another highlight was the vibrant colors achieved using natural plant dyes from herbs and spices like indigo, cumin, and turmeric. It adds a unique touch to your practice space.

However, there are also some cons to consider. The rug's grip quality might take some time to get used to, especially during sweaty sessions. It's recommended to use it with a regular yoga mat initially until you feel comfortable solely using the rug.

Also, while it's suitable for all types of yoga styles, some users might find the rug moving around on smoother surfaces. So, using this rug on a textured or carpeted floor would provide better grip and stability.

Additionally, although the rug has a soft texture, it might feel slightly uncomfortable for beginners or those with sensitive hands. But after a few uses, you'll likely grow to appreciate the natural feel and the way cotton grips better when you're all sweaty.

In conclusion, the Jade Yoga Rug Black offers an authentic yoga experience, connecting you with the roots of yoga practice. Its unique characteristics may require some adjustments, but once you get accustomed, it adds a whole new dimension to your practice.

### [Jade Yoga Harmony Professional Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-professional-3-16-yoga-mat-a1375485-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-professional-3-16-yoga-mat-a1375485-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Jade Yoga Harmony Professional (3 16") Yoga Mat has made a significant impact on my life recently. It's not just a mat, but it provides a stable and secure foundation for my yoga practice. The open cell technology ensures a non-slip performance, which is particularly helpful when I'm attempting new, more challenging poses.

[The thick design of this yoga mat offers comfort and stability during standing poses.](https://gist.github.com/acodereviewersbestfriend2/fe2153a921214edb66c0ca332dab1653) Interestingly, it's made from natural rubber, a sustainable and eco-friendly resource. I find this aspect very refreshing, as I'm consciously trying to make my lifestyle more green.

Cleaning the mat is a breeze too. I use warm water and mild soap, and the mat stays fresh and clean.

However, there are a few downsides to this mat. First, the strong rubber smell that lingers for a while after unpacking. I had to air it out for a few days before I could use it. Plus, it's a bit heavy, which makes it slightly inconvenient to carry around.

Despite these minor issues, I can't deny the quality and performance of this mat. It has greatly enhanced my yoga practice, providing the comfort, grip, and stability that I need. If you're into yoga and looking for a high-quality mat, the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional might be just what you need.

### [Jade Harmony Extra Wide Yoga Mat, Olive Green](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-olive-green-374ol-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-olive-green-374ol-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently stumbled upon the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat in olive green (374OL) and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my daily yoga practice. First off, the extra width and length are perfect for taller people like myself. Not only does it provide ample space for my stretches, but it also offers a sense of comfort and stability that I haven't found in other mats.

One of the best features of this mat is how it doesn't contain any harmful materials like PVC, latex, or synthetic rubbers. Instead, it's made from 99% natural tree rubber, which gives it an amazingly grippy texture - perfect for those sweaty yoga sessions! And speaking of grippiness, I've been using this mat in hot yoga classes too, and despite the heat and humidity, it stays in place and keeps me grounded.

However, I must admit that the natural rubber does have a slightly unpleasant odor when you first unroll the mat. But don't worry, as one reviewer mentioned, this smell fades quite quickly after some use.

The only downside I've experienced so far is the weight of the mat - it's quite heavy due to the rubber material. So if you're someone who commutes with their yoga mat, you might want to consider getting a lighter version instead.

All in all, I absolutely love my Jade Harmony Yoga Mat! It's durable, comfortable, and environmentally friendly - everything you could ask for in a yoga mat. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to invest in a high-quality mat that will last you for years to come.
