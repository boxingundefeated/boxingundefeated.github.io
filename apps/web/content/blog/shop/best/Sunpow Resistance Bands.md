### [Whatafit 11-Piece Resistance Band Set](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/sunpow-resistance-bands)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/sunpow-resistance-bands"><img alt="whatafit-resistance-bands-set-11pcsexercise-bands-with-door-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/whatafit-resistance-bands-set-11pcsexercise-bands-with-door-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Whatafit Resistance Bands Set and let me tell you, this little bundle packs quite a punch! The first thing that caught my eye was the colorful bands, each one with a clear resistance level marked on it. It's such a convenient feature that you don't often see in exercise bands.

The bands are multifunctional, making them great for a variety of exercises. They're also incredibly lightweight and portable, making them perfect for those who like to work out on-the-go or at home. However, one thing I did notice was the smaller size of the handles which can be a bit rough on some people's hands.

Another con is the resistance levels not quite matching up with what's advertised. Some users reported needing to double up on the bands to get a decent resistance level. But hey, if you're looking to save some money without compromising too much on quality, these resistance bands might just be what you need.

All in all, the Whatafit Resistance Bands Set offers a good balance between price and performance. It may not be perfect, but it gets the job done.

Although the Spawn Fitness Resistance Band Set has been an invaluable addition to my workout routine, I have to admit that I could see some room for improvement.
