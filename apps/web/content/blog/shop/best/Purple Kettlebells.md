### [Onnit Bigfoot 90lb Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been incorporating the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) into my workout routine, and I must say it's been a game-changer. The unique design of this kettlebell, featuring a detailed Sasquatch face, not only adds a fun twist to my exercise regimen but also inspires me to push harder and break through my fitness plateaus.

One aspect that really stands out about the Bigfoot kettlebell is its sturdiness. The solid cast iron construction makes it feel incredibly secure and reliable during even my most intense workout sessions. It's evident that Onnit took great care in crafting this piece, as evidenced by the even weight distribution and comfortable grip.

Another highlight of this product is its excellent durability. Despite using it multiple times a week for several weeks now, the paint hasn't chipped or worn off in any significant way – a testament to the high-quality materials and manufacturing process employed by Onnit.

However, one minor issue I've encountered with the Bigfoot kettlebell is the way its ears stick out. While this design choice certainly contributes to the product's eye-catching appearance, it can sometimes make certain exercises, like holding the bell by the ears during squats, feel slightly awkward or uncomfortable.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) to anyone looking to add a little excitement and motivation to their fitness routine. Its unique design, top-notch construction, and impressive durability make it an excellent addition to any home gym. Just be mindful of the ear placement if you plan on using it for specific exercises that require a comfortable grip.

### [Yes4all 100 lb Powder Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="yes4all-powder-coated-cast-iron-competition-kettlebell-32-kg-71-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yes4all-powder-coated-cast-iron-competition-kettlebell-32-kg-71-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sure, I'd love to review the Yes4all Powder Coated Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell, 32 kg, 71 lb. I've been using this kettlebell in my gym routines and I must say, it's a game-changer!

Firstly, the powder-coated finish is a game-changer. It's not just about the rust and corrosion resistance it provides, but also the grip strength it enhances. During my intense workout sessions, I was sweating profusely, but I never had to worry about the kettlebell slipping out of my hands.

The slightly textured handle was another standout feature for me. It provides a secure grip, allowing me to swing the kettlebell with confidence. I used to dread the squat-swing-swing-swing exercise, but now I enjoy it, all thanks to this kettlebell.

The weight accuracy is another highlight. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the kettlebell was accurate to within 2% of the stated weight. This level of precision is important, especially when you're using it for competition purposes.

However, there are a few cons that need to be addressed. Firstly, the kettlebell is a bit heavy, especially for beginners. It took me a few sessions to get used to the 32 kg weight. Secondly, the packaging could be improved. The kettlebell was loosely packed in a box, and I was a bit worried it might get damaged during transit.

In conclusion, the Yes4all Powder Coated Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell is a reliable and durable workout companion. It's perfect for anyone looking to enhance their strength training routines. However, beginners might find the weight too heavy, and the packaging could be improved to ensure the product's safety during transit.

### [10 LB Vinyl Coated Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weights-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weights-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who enjoys working out at home, I recently decided to incorporate kettlebell exercises into my fitness routine. After browsing through various options, I decided to give the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell Weights a try. The brightly-colored vinyl coating caught my eye, and the diverse weight options allowed me to find the right weight to match my fitness level.

From the moment I received the kettlebell, it was clear I had made the right choice. The quality of the cast iron was undeniable, and the vinyl coating not only added a pop of color to my workout space but also proved to be incredibly durable. As I began my workouts, I appreciated the wide handle that allowed me to comfortably grip the kettlebell with both hands, ensuring that I was able to maintain proper form and maximize the effectiveness of each exercise.

I was also pleasantly surprised by how quiet the kettlebell was during use. The vinyl coating significantly reduced noise and prevented damage to the flooring in my workout area. The weight options ranging from 5 to 50 pounds provided me with ample opportunity for progression in my workouts, and the stability of the flat bottom design allowed me to confidently switch hands during my reps.

In terms of storage, I found the vinyl coated kettlebell weights to be quite space-efficient. Their compact design made it easy for me to store them in a corner of my workout area without taking up too much space. Additionally, the clearly marked weights on each kettlebell made it convenient for me to track my progress and ensure that I was consistently challenging myself during my workouts.

There are a few minor drawbacks to the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Kettlebell Weights that I discovered during my testing. While the vinyl coating adds a great deal of durability and protection, it can be somewhat slippery when your hands become sweaty. Additionally, the kettlebell is quite heavy even in the lighter weight options, which may not be suitable for individuals with limited strength or mobility.

Overall, I am quite impressed with the Philosophy Gym Vinyl Coated Kettlebell Weights. They have effectively enhanced my home workout routine, providing me with a variety of challenging exercises that help to improve my strength and overall fitness. The durability of the cast iron construction, along with the convenience and storage efficiency provided by the vinyl coating, make these kettlebells a valuable addition to any fitness enthusiast's collection.

### [15 lbs Vinyl Kettlebell for Full Body Workout](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="yes4all-vinyl-coated-kettlebell-great-for-full-body-workout-15-lbs-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yes4all-vinyl-coated-kettlebell-great-for-full-body-workout-15-lbs-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Introducing Yes4All's Vinyl Kettlebell, the perfect addition to your home workout routine! This high-quality cast iron kettlebell is designed to last, ensuring you get the most out of your workout. The sleek vinyl coating not only adds a pop of color to your workout space but also protects your floors and reduces noise, making this kettlebell perfect for indoor or outdoor use.

One of the standout features of this kettlebell is its comfortable, slightly textured handle that provides a secure grip for high reps. This eliminates the need for chalk, making your workouts mess-free and enjoyable. Additionally, the kettlebell's flat bottom design allows for easy storage and opens up a world of new exercise possibilities compared to traditional kettlebells.

I've been using this Yes4All Kettlebell for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! The solid cast iron construction is incredibly durable, and I love how the vinyl coating adds a unique touch to my workout space. The textured handle is a game-changer, offering a comfortable grip that makes it easy to power through my workouts without worrying about losing control.

On the downside, some users have reported inconsistencies in the color of the vinyl coating on their kettlebells, which may be a concern for those who prioritize aesthetics. Additionally, the handle size may not suit everyone, especially those with larger hands. However, overall, I believe the Yes4All Vinyl Kettlebell is an excellent choice for anyone looking to add a versatile and effective workout tool to their fitness arsenal.

### [5 lb Vinyl Coated Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="everyday-essentials-all-purpose-color-vinyl-coated-kettlebells-5-lbs-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/everyday-essentials-all-purpose-color-vinyl-coated-kettlebells-5-lbs-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So, I've been using the Everyday Essentials All-Purpose Color Vinyl Coated Kettlebell, 5 lbs for a while now and let me tell you, it's been quite a ride! To start with, the solid cast-iron construction coated with vinyl gives it a nice sturdy feel. I love the neoprene bottoms on my home gym's wood floors. They provide excellent protection against any scuffs or scratching. However, the thick coating on the handle is not my favorite part. It can be a bit uncomfortable during certain moves depending on my hand's condition.

The design comfort isn't compromised though. The kettlebell has a wide handle that fits most hand sizes comfortably, and the non-slip grip gives me complete control over my movements. It's also easy to recognize the weight due to its color-coded vinyl design. However, packaging could use some improvement. Some users received their kettlebells damaged, which isn't a good look for an otherwise well-made product.

In terms of usability, these kettlebells are a game-changer. The compound kettlebell exercises demand the use of multiple joints, which engages all the larger muscles of my body. This helps me burn calories faster than isolation moves, focusing more on multi-joint exercises. And let's not forget about the portability! With its round profile and integrated loop handle, it works perfectly as weight resistance and counter-balance for various upper-body and lower-body exercises.

Overall, the Everyday Essentials All-Purpose Color Vinyl Coated Kettlebell, 5 lbs is a solid choice if you're looking to kickstart your fitness journey. It may have some minor flaws, but its durability and ease of use make it a worthy investment.

### [Periwinkle Blue 8lb Soft-Shell Kettleball](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="popsugar-8lb-soft-shell-kettlebell-periwinkle-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/popsugar-8lb-soft-shell-kettlebell-periwinkle-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Popsugar's 8lb Neoprene Soft-Shell Kettlebell in Periwinkle Blue has been a game-changer in my workout routine. The soft-shell design not only provides a comfortable grip that prevents any slipping, but it also protects my floors from being scratched or damaged. The flat-bottom design ensures the kettlebell stays stable and doesn't roll away when not in use.

One of the highlights of this kettlebell is its versatility. Incorporating it into various exercises like kettlebell swings, goblet squats, Turkish get-ups, and renegade rows has allowed me to engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously and improve my strength, endurance, and overall fitness.

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. First, the neoprene material may not be as durable as other kettlebells in the long run. Second, the soft-shell design might make it difficult to perform some exercises if you're looking for a more challenging workout.

Overall, I appreciate the Popsugar 8lb Neoprene Soft-Shell Kettlebell for its comfortable grip, stylish design, and versatility in different workouts. It has definitely made a positive impact on my fitness journey!

### [Blogilates Coral Pink 15lb Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

As a fitness enthusiast, I've been using the Blogilates Iron Kettlebell in Coral Pink 15lbs for a few weeks now. Let me tell you, this kettlebell is a game-changer! It's stylish, versatile, and packs quite a punch when it comes to strength training.

First off, the color is just stunning. It's a bright coral pink that adds a fun pop of color to my workout space. Plus, the gold handle is a nice touch that elevates the overall aesthetic.

In terms of functionality, this kettlebell is everything I could ask for. Its weight is perfect for beginners or those looking to switch up their routine with some lighter weights. The compact size makes it easy to store and transport, making it ideal for home workouts.

Now, onto the not-so-great parts. Some reviewers mentioned receiving dirty or scratched kettlebells. However, I didn't encounter any issues like that. My kettlebell arrived in pristine condition, so I'm not sure what others experienced. Additionally, I noticed that the color is slightly different than what's shown online. It leans more towards mauve than the bright pink shown in the pictures.

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Blogilates Iron Kettlebell in Coral Pink 15lbs. It's stylish, effective, and has truly transformed my workout routine. If you're looking for a high-quality kettlebell that will make your workouts more enjoyable, look no further!

I recently incorporated the All in Motion 10lb Aqua Cast Iron Vinyl Coating Kettlebell into my workout routine, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. I love how comfortable the handle is - it's easy to grip even when my hands are sweaty. The range of weights available has allowed me to start slow and gradually progress as I get stronger.

One thing that really stood out to me about this kettlebell is its exceptional durability. Despite being used almost daily for the past few months, it still looks and feels brand new. The vinyl coating not only gives it a sleek appearance but also protects my floor from any damage.

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. The first one is the price point. While I understand that fitness equipment tends to be on the pricier side, especially during the pandemic, it would be great to see more affordable options. Another small issue is the packaging. Some users have reported receiving their kettlebells with minor scuffs and dings, which could be avoided if the product were better protected during shipping.

Overall, I would highly recommend the All in Motion 10lb Aqua Cast Iron Vinyl Coating Kettlebell. Its comfortable grip, excellent durability, and wide range of weights make it an excellent addition to any home gym. Just be prepared to pay a premium price for this high-quality piece of equipment.

As a fitness enthusiast, I was excited to get my hands on the Svelte Fit Kettlebell Lilac. Its beautiful lilac color caught my eye and the weight of 6 kg felt just right for me.

The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it was to hold, thanks to the ergonomic design. The 4 protective [pads](https://best.serp.co/shop/pads/) at the bottom prevented any damage to my floor, which was a big relief.

However, one thing that irritated me a bit is the bulky feel of the handle. It wasn't as comfortable as I hoped it would be during longer workout sessions.

Yet, despite this minor inconvenience, the Svelte Fit Kettlebell Lilac has been a joy to use. The vinyl coating makes it easy to clean and maintain, adding to its overall appeal.

In conclusion, although the handle of this kettlebell could be designed better for comfort, its eye-catching color, protective pads, and vinyl coating make it a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking to incorporate kettlebells into their fitness routine.

One drawback I noticed is that the handle has a ridge on both sides which can cut up your hands a bit. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's worth mentioning. Another small issue is that the orange vinyl lining is split on the face of the bell, which doesn't affect its functionality but does make it look a little less polished.

### [Aeromat Elite Mini Kettlebell & Medicine Ball: 5 lbs, Purple](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

As a fitness enthusiast, I have to say that the Aeromat Elite Mini Kettlebell is a game-changer. This 5-pounder has been my go-to workout buddy during my morning workout sessions. The first thing that drew me to it was its non-scuffing design. I was pleasantly surprised how smooth it is when I perform kettlebell swings, making it perfect for home use where floors can be easily scratched.

Another feature that I love about this kettlebell is the durability factor. The molded handle provides a comfortable grip, which means it won't slip out of my hands during intense workout sessions. Plus, the synthetic rubber coating gives it a nice texture that is gentle on my hands yet robust enough to endure daily use.

However, there's one thing I wish was different about this product - the weight distribution. Although it's advertised as a 5-pounder, it feels lighter than I expected. For someone like me who's looking for a bit more challenge, this might not be the best option.

Nevertheless, the Aeromat Elite Mini Kettlebell still impresses with its functionality and ease of use. Its flat base ensures it stays stable on the ground, making it safe and secure during workouts.

### [Healthy You Vinyl Coated 30lb Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="healthy-you-vinyl-coated-kettlebell-30-lb-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/healthy-you-vinyl-coated-kettlebell-30-lb-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The vinyl coating certainly deserves a special mention. Not only does it protect my floor from scratches but it also keeps the noise level down, making my early morning workouts less disruptive for my neighbors. Not to mention, it prevents any potential rusting from causing damage.

The handle, textured and comfortable, makes holding the weights safe and secure. It feels like I'm in full control, even on those days when my grip strength isn't quite as robust. The weight being clearly printed on the front? A brilliant touch. It's always good to quickly glance at your progress without having to fumblingly weigh your kettlebell.

However, the thing that really sets this kettlebell apart from others is its flat bottom. I've always struggled with kettlebells that roll all over the place during my workout sessions. This one stays completely steady and simplifies my storage.

The only minor negative I could spot is the fact that it's sold individually. Though, I understand it's because it comes in different weights to cater to everyone's needs, so it's not much of a deal breaker.
