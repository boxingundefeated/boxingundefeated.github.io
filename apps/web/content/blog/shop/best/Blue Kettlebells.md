### [Adjustable Women's Kettlebell - 5-12 lbs](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/blue-kettlebells)

### [Aeromat Elite 18 LB Kettlebell - Blue](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/blue-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/blue-kettlebells"><img alt="aeromat-elite-18-lb-kettlebell-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aeromat-elite-18-lb-kettlebell-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently incorporated the Aeromat Elite 18 lb Kettlebell into my fitness routine, and I must say, it has been quite an experience. The first thing that caught my attention was the pliable material structure, which made it a friendly alternative to traditional cast iron kettlebells.

Another great thing about this equipment is its versatility, as it's suitable for core function, abdominal strength, and rotational movement training.

However, there were some negatives as well. The handle, while comfortable, can be a bit difficult to hold onto with both hands due to its size. Additionally, some customers have reported misrepresentation in terms of what was delivered compared to what was advertised.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I believe the Aeromat Elite 18 lb Kettlebell is worth considering for anyone looking to diversify their workout routine and achieve their fitness goals. Give it a try and see if it works for you!
