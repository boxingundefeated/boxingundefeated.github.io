### [Folding 20oz Collapsible Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/slim-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/slim-water-bottles"><img alt="mayim-20oz-collapsible-carabiner-bottle-at-free-people-in-orange-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mayim-20oz-collapsible-carabiner-bottle-at-free-people-in-orange-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'm an avid traveler, and I always need a water bottle on-hand. The Mayim Collapsible Carabiner Bottle has been my go-to for several trips now. It's lightweight and easy to pack, which is crucial when I'm trying to keep my bag as light as possible. The collapsible feature is one I absolutely love. When I'm not using it, or when it's almost empty, I just collapse it so it takes up minimal space in my bag. Its 20 oz capacity is also convenient for travel since it holds enough water but isn't too bulky.

One downside I've noticed is that it's not very well insulated. If I fill it with ice, the water tends to get warm faster than I'd like it to. But overall, this bottle has been a game-changer for me on my trips. It's durable, easy to clean, and has a secure cap that keeps water from spilling. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable travel water bottle.

The Asobu Skinny Mini is my go-to bottle for daily use. I purchased it as I wanted a compact and lightweight option to carry around in my purse.

Its vibrant colors add a touch of charm, making it a stylish accessory for any outfit.

One thing that truly stands out about the Skinny Mini is its exceptional insulation. I've found that whether I fill it with iced tea or hot coffee, my beverage remains at the optimal temperature for hours. This is particularly useful during long commutes or hikes when I want to enjoy a hot drink without having to constantly refill it.

However, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the screw top can be a bit difficult to twist off at times, making it slightly inconvenient to access your drink quickly. Additionally, the material used for the lid feels somewhat flimsy, which concerns me about its durability.

Overall, the Asobu Skinny Mini has become an essential part of my daily routine. Its lightweight design, excellent insulation, and vibrant colors make it a stylish and practical choice for anyone looking for a compact and functional water bottle.
