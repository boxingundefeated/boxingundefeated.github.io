### [Gaiam Premium Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-lily-shadows-print-yoga-mat-6-mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-lily-shadows-print-yoga-mat-6-mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started practicing yoga and purchased the Gaiam Premium Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat. I didn't know what to expect at first, but I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer for my practice. The thickness of this mat is just perfect - my joints feel so well-cushioned and protected during sessions. Plus, the beautiful design adds a nice touch of elegance to my home studio.

One thing that really stood out for me was the non-slip surface. Even when I'm dripping sweat (which happens a lot, let's be honest), the mat doesn't budge beneath me. It keeps me grounded and focused on my form, allowing me to get the maximum benefit from each pose.

However, if there's one thing that could be improved, it would be the smell. While not overpowering, it does have a slight chemical odor that might take some time to get used to. However, it hasn't bothered me too much, especially since the benefits of using it far outweigh this minor inconvenience.

In conclusion, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Gaiam Premium Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat. Its durability, comfort, and traction make it a must-have for any serious yogi. Despite its initial scent, I'd still highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their practice or simply want a more comfortable and stable surface for their workout.

### [Manduka PRO Yoga Mat in Verve Red (6mm Thickness)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="manduka-pro-yoga-mat-6mm-verve-red-standard-72" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/manduka-pro-yoga-mat-6mm-verve-red-standard-72/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Manduka PRO Yoga Mat, and I must say, it's a game-changer! Now, I've been using this mat for a couple of months now, and it's truly made a difference in my yoga practice.

Firstly, the grip - this mat has an incredible grip that doesn't fade even when I'm drenched in sweat. As someone who tends to sweat a lot during yoga, this is a massive plus for me. Plus, it's a high-density mat, so it provides excellent cushioning for my joints, especially my knees.

One of the things that stood out for me was how well-made the mat is. It's thick, so it feels really sturdy and durable, which is essential for someone like me who uses it often. Also, the closed-cell surface prevents sweat, moisture, and bacteria from seeping into the mat. This has made cleaning the mat a breeze, and it's also prolonged its lifespan.

However, there are a few cons to consider. Firstly, this mat is quite heavy, so it's not the most travel-friendly option. Secondly, it tends to get a little slippery when wet, so you might need a yoga towel for extra grip.

In summary, the Manduka PRO Yoga Mat is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their yoga practice. Its superior grip, cushioning, and durability make it a worthwhile investment. However, its heaviness and tendency to get slippery when wet could make it less suitable for some people. Overall, it's one of the best yoga mats I've ever used, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else.

### [Soft and Sticky 6mm Yoga Mat in Sublime Sky](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-sublime-sky-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-sublime-sky-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[I recently got my hands on the Gaiam Sublime Sky yoga mat, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in my daily practice.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) The calming colors instantly caught my eye, as they help to keep me grounded and focused throughout my sessions.

One of the standout features of this mat is its supremely cushioning 6mm thick design. Made from latex-free PVC with no harmful phthalates, it offers a comfortable surface for even the toughest poses. And with its textured "sticky" surface, I can confidently say goodbye to any slip-ups during my practice. Plus, Gaiam's exclusive lifetime yoga mat guarantee adds an extra layer of reassurance that this mat is built to last.

However, not everything has been perfect. Some users reported that this mat is too soft, causing joint pain and making it difficult to maintain proper alignment. Others mentioned experiencing a strong chemical odor that took days to dissipate. Additionally, there have been some complaints about the slippery nature of the mat, although these can often be resolved with proper care and washing techniques.

Overall, the Gaiam Sublime Sky yoga mat has been a great addition to my practice, offering both comfort and style. While there are some minor drawbacks to consider, such as the softness and odor, these may not be significant issues for everyone. If you're on the market for a well-made, durable yoga mat that comes with some added bonuses, the Gaiam Sublime Sky might just be the perfect choice for you.

### [Reversible Premium Yoga Mat with Lifetime Guarantee](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-reversible-yoga-mat-boho-folk-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-reversible-yoga-mat-boho-folk-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was initially skeptical about using a yoga mat as I'm not particularly fond of exercising, but the Gaiam Premium Print Reversible Yoga Mat has truly changed my perspective. The moment I unrolled it, I was captivated by the vibrant boho folk design and the comforting 6mm thickness that was perfect for enhancing my yoga practice at home.

The first time I used it, I could instantly feel a difference in my poses. The textured surface provided a non-slip performance, even when my hands started to sweat. As I continued to practice, the mat became even more grippy, which was a pleasant surprise.

One thing that stood out to me was the level of comfort this yoga mat provides. With its generous 6mm thickness, I no longer need to worry about protecting my joints from the hard floor.

However, there were a few cons that I encountered. The main issue was the initial strong odor that the mat emitted. While it was harmless, the smell was quite pungent and took a few days to dissipate. It's important to note that airing out the mat for a couple of days before using it is crucial to minimize the odor.

Additionally, I noticed that some parts of the mat were more slippery than others, which made it difficult to maintain certain poses. However, I found that wiping the mat with a damp cloth and leaving it to dry overnight helped to increase its stickiness and grip.

All in all, I would highly recommend the Gaiam Premium Print Reversible Yoga Mat. The vibrant design, non-slip performance, and cushioned support make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced yogis who want to enhance their practice at home.

### [Premium Metallic Luminary Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-luminary-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-luminary-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam 6mm Premium Yoga Mat - Luminary for a couple of months now and it's been a game-changer in my yoga practice. The first thing that caught my attention was the beautiful metallic print, which instantly elevates the overall aesthetic of the mat.

The thickness of the mat is perfect for providing ample cushioning and support to my joints during various poses. Its textured surface also ensures a non-slip performance, giving me confidence in holding challenging poses without worrying about sliding or losing balance. However, it does take some getting used to as it initially felt quite firm and hard.

One downside was the initial strong chemical smell upon unpacking the mat, which took a few days to dissipate. But once that was gone, using this mat has been a breeze.

I also found it easy to clean by wiping it down with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Its lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, making it my go-to mat for yoga sessions both at home and in the park.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the Gaiam 6mm Premium Yoga Mat - Luminary. Its durability, grip, and thickness make it an excellent choice for any yogi looking to enhance their practice.

### [Peaceful Waters Reversible 6mm Yoga Mat for Gaiam](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-reversible-peaceful-waters-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-reversible-peaceful-waters-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried numerous mats in my quest for the perfect companion to my practice. That's why I was excited to try out Gaiam's Premium Reversible Peaceful Waters Yoga Mat. The moment I unrolled it, I was instantly drawn to its serene water-themed design. Not only is it a pleasure to look at, but it's also incredibly comfortable.

The mat's 6mm thickness provides ample cushioning, making poses like plank and downward-facing dog more comfortable and less strain on my wrists and knees. Moreover, the bi-sided design gives me a choice of beautiful designs to suit my mood or match my outfit.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the grip quality isn't as good as some other mats I've used. When I get sweaty during intense sessions, my hands start to slide, which can be disruptive. But this issue has eased off as the mat has broken in over time.

Another point worth mentioning is that although the mat doesn't have a strong odor like some of its counterparts, there's a mild smell that took a few days to dissipate.

In terms of maintenance, this yoga mat is easy to clean and maintain. A simple wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to keep it fresh and hygienic. Its portability is also commendable, as it rolls up compactly and fits into most yoga bags.

Overall, Gaiam's Premium Reversible Peaceful Waters Yoga Mat is a solid choice for yogis looking for a comfortable, well-made mat with a unique design. While it may not have the best grip initially, it's still a reliable option that allows you to enjoy your practice without breaking the bank.

## Buyer's Guide

### Important Features to Look for in 6mm Yoga Mats

When shopping for a 6mm yoga mat, there are several important features to consider:

- Thickness: A 6mm mat is usually considered ideal as it provides sufficient cushioning for comfort during practice while maintaining stability and balance.

- Non-slip Surface: The surface of the mat should be designed to prevent slipping, even when you're sweaty. Look for mats with textured surfaces or those that utilize materials that naturally grip the ground and your hands or feet.

- Durability: Choose a mat made from high-quality, long-lasting materials. This not only ensures your yoga practice remains comfortable, but it also saves you from needing to replace your mat frequently.

### Considerations for Choosing the Right 6mm Yoga Mat

Before making a purchase, think about these factors:

- Intended Use: Consider the types of yoga you practice. If you engage in highly active styles like ashtanga or vinyasa, a more cushioned mat might be necessary for joint protection. For gentler practices like hatha or restorative yoga, a less cushioned mat might be sufficient.

- Portability: Will you be traveling with your mat? If so, look for lightweight mats that are easy to pack and carry. Some mats also roll up, which can be more convenient for some users than folding mats.

- Washing & Care: Lastly, consider the cleaning requirements of the mat. Some mats are machine washable, while others require hand washing or spot cleaning.

[Remember, investing in a good quality 6mm yoga mat is important for both your comfort and effectiveness during practice.](https://gist.github.com/acodereviewersbestfriend2/fe2153a921214edb66c0ca332dab1653) Always read reviews and specifications carefully, and choose a mat that best suits your needs and preferences.

## FAQ

### 1. What is the standard thickness of a 6mm yoga mat?

A 6mm yoga mat is typically 0.24 inches thick. This thickness is considered medium-thickness and provides a good balance between cushioning and stability during your yoga practice.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6mm+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="6mm Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

### 2. How do 6mm yoga mats compare to other thickness levels?

Compared to thinner mats, such as 3mm or 4mm ones, 6mm yoga mats offer more cushioning and support, reducing strain on joints and making practice more comfortable. However, they are not as thick as some ultra-cushioned mats (around 8-10mm), which may be preferred by people with more sensitive joints or beginners seeking extra support. It's essential to determine your individual needs and preferences when choosing a yoga mat thickness.

### 3. Are 6mm yoga mats suitable for all types of yoga practice?

Yes, 6mm yoga mats can accommodate most styles of yoga practice, including Vinyasa, Hatha, Ashtanga, and Iyengar. Their medium thickness provides enough cushioning for poses on hard surfaces while maintaining stability during balance poses and inversions. However, if you have specific needs or conditions, consider consulting with a yoga instructor or professional to determine the best mat thickness for your practice.

### 4. How do I clean a 6mm yoga mat?

1. Mix a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar or use a mild dish soap.

2. Dampen a soft cloth with the cleaning solution and gently wipe down the surface of the mat, paying special attention to areas with sweat or oils.

3. Rinse the cloth with water and wring it out. Wipe down the mat again to remove any soap residue.

4. Allow the mat to air dry completely before rolling it up or storing it.

### 5. Can 6mm yoga mats be used outdoors?

Yes, 6mm yoga mats can be used outdoors, but you should consider the specific material and quality of your mat. Some yoga mats designed for indoor use may wear out or degrade more quickly when exposed to outdoor elements such as sunlight, dust, and moisture. Look for a yoga mat made with high-quality, durable materials if you plan on using it outdoors frequently.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6mm+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="6mm Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

### 6. How do I store my 6mm yoga mat when not in use?

After each practice, clean and dry your 6mm yoga mat thoroughly. Then, roll it up tightly with the top (smooth) side facing outwards to protect the surface. Try to store your mat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Using a yoga mat storage bag or strap can help keep your mat clean, compact, and easy to transport.

### 7. How long do 6mm yoga mats typically last?

The lifespan of a 6mm yoga mat depends on factors such as frequency of use, personal care, and the quality of the material. With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality 6mm yoga mat can last anywhere from 6 months to 2 years or more. Investing in a well-made mat from a reputable brand can help ensure that you get the most out of your yoga practice and enjoy the benefits of your mat for as long as possible.
