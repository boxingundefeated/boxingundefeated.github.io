### [5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="life-energy-5mm-ekosmart-cork-yoga-mat-with-yoga-strap-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/life-energy-5mm-ekosmart-cork-yoga-mat-with-yoga-strap-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got to try out the Life Energy 5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap and it has quickly become my favorite yoga accessory. As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried various mats but nothing compares to the grip, comfort, and eco-friendliness of this Life Energy cork mat.

The high point for me was the non-slip cork surface. It's amazing how it becomes even more stable with heat and sweat, providing the best grip for any pose. This quality is particularly useful during hot yoga sessions when most mats would be slippery from all the sweat.

Another feature that stood out was its eco-friendliness. Being made from sustainable materials like cork and TPE, it doesn't contain any harmful chemicals or smells. Plus, it's recyclable which is a big plus for those concerned about the impact of their purchases on the environment.

However, one minor downside is the weight of the mat. It's slightly heavier than traditional mats due to the thickness of the cork but the included yoga strap helps make it easier to carry around.

Overall, the Life Energy 5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap has definitely stepped up my yoga game. Its eco-friendliness, non-slip surface, and comfortable cushioning make it an excellent choice for any yoga enthusiast looking to enhance their practice.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="yoharmony-eco-friendly-jute-yoga-mat-pilates-mat-exercise-mat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yoharmony-eco-friendly-jute-yoga-mat-pilates-mat-exercise-mat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently stumbled upon the YoHarmony Eco Friendly Jute Yoga Mat Pilates Mat [Exercise Mat](https://best.serp.co/shop/exercise-mat/), and I must say, it has quickly become my go-to workout companion. The moment I unrolled it, I was greeted with the softness and plush texture that jute naturally provides. Its 24" x 72" size offers ample space for all my yoga, pilates, and other exercise routines without feeling cramped or limited in movement.

What I appreciate most about this mat is its eco-friendliness. Made from a blend of natural jute and lightweight PVC, this mat is not only environmentally sustainable but also incredibly easy to carry around. Its resilience and strength are a testament to the quality of the material used, making it perfect for even my most intense workout sessions.

However, there's one minor drawback I've noticed – the mat tends to absorb moisture, which sometimes can make it feel a bit damp during extended use. But overall, the YoHarmony Jute Yoga Mat has exceeded my expectations and has undoubtedly enhanced my workout experience.

### [Environmentally-Friendly Cork Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="peaceful-mountain-satoriconcept-cork-yoga-mat-w-strap-eco-friendly-lightweight-72x24-4mm-non-slip-sw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/peaceful-mountain-satoriconcept-cork-yoga-mat-w-strap-eco-friendly-lightweight-72x24-4mm-non-slip-sw-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a dedicated yoga enthusiast, I've been on a constant quest for the perfect yoga mat. Imagine my delight when I found the Peaceful Mountain SatoriConcept Cork Yoga Mat! This eco-friendly mat is not just your regular yoga mat; it's a game-changer.

Its unique cork material is naturally anti-slip, providing an unmatched grip even during the most intense yoga sessions. Its self-cleaning property is another bonus. I used to worry about the bacteria buildup on my old mat, but now, I can practice without worrying about germs. Plus, its lightweight design makes it easy for me to bring it along wherever I go.

However, it's not all roses. The mat tends to get a little noisy during certain poses, which can be a bit distracting for someone like me who prefers a quiet practice space. Also, the natural material may not suit everyone's taste, especially those who prefer a softer feel.

Overall, the Peaceful Mountain SatoriConcept Cork Yoga Mat is an excellent choice for yogis who are conscious about the environment and their personal practice. Its unique features make it stand out from the rest, making it a worthy addition to any yoga practice.

### [Joluvi Blue Yoga Mat with Rubber Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

I've had the pleasure of practicing yoga on this Jute Yoga Mat Joluvi Blue Rubber, and I must say, it's become my trusted workout buddy. The 120 x 60 x 1.5 dimensions provide a solid foundation for my poses, making me feel secure and stable during my sessions. The mat's 100% EVA rubber material adds extra cushioning, protecting my knees and wrists from any discomfort.

One of the standout features of this product is its return policy - within 30 days, you can return it if you're not completely satisfied. This gives users peace of mind knowing that their investment is protected. The only slightly negative aspect I noticed was that some users might find the blue color too bold for their taste.

In summary, the Jute Yoga Mat Joluvi Blue Rubber is a high-quality, safe option for yogis of all levels. Its sturdy dimensions, comfortable EVA rubber material, and reliable return policy make it worth every penny.

### [Eco-Friendly Hemp Yoga Mat with Extra Grip](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="fitccessory-hemp-yoga-mat-brown-1-item-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fitccessory-hemp-yoga-mat-brown-1-item-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started a yoga practice and found myself in need of a reliable, eco-friendly mat. That's when I stumbled upon the Fitccessory Hemp Yoga Mat in brown. As soon as I unrolled it, I could tell this wasn't your average yoga mat - it felt more like a cozy blanket beneath my feet. The unique blend of hemp and jute materials gave me an unparalleled grip, making every downward dog feel stable and secure.

Speaking of stability, the natural rubber backing provides extra traction, so you don't have to worry about slipping during those sweatier sessions. Plus, the double-sided design means I can switch up my practice without getting bored. Even though the mat has a certain weight to it, I appreciate that it's PVC-free, which is better for both me and the environment.

One minor concern is the placement of the logo in the middle of the mat, which can sometimes be distracting during certain poses. Another potential drawback is its size; at 183 x 61 x 0.5 cm, it might not be the best choice for Ashtanga yoga or other practices that require a lot of space.

Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Fitccessory Hemp Yoga Mat. Its durable, eco-friendly materials and exceptional grip make it the perfect companion for my evolving yoga practice.

### [Natural Jute Yoga Mat for Travelers and Yogis](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="premium-travel-yoga-mat-non-slip-sustainable-jute-natural-rubber-ethical-yoga-pilates-exercise-mat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/premium-travel-yoga-mat-non-slip-sustainable-jute-natural-rubber-ethical-yoga-pilates-exercise-mat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Premium Travel Yoga Mat for quite some time now, and it's been a game-changer for my yoga practice. The first thing that struck me about this mat is its compactness. Weighing only 1.3KG at 2mm, it's incredibly lightweight and easy to fold, making it perfect for travel. Its size and weight make it easy to slip into my backpack or suitcase when I'm on the go.

[The mat's unique blend of jute fibres and natural rubber is another standout feature.](https://best.serp.co/shop/jute-rugs/) This combination not only ensures a non-slip surface but also adds to its durability and resilience during even the most intense yoga sessions. Plus, the mat's non-toxic nature provides peace of mind, knowing that I'm engaging in a healthier form of exercise without any harmful chemicals involved.

One feature that's helped me improve as a beginner is the mat's CompleteGrip Technology. This innovative technology ensures that I maintain a firm grip no matter how much I sweat, giving me the confidence to push my boundaries during practice.

However, there are a couple of downsides to this mat. Its lightweight nature can also be a drawback, as it may not provide as much cushioning as thicker mats. This may not be a problem for everyone, but it's something to keep in mind if you prefer a softer surface underneath you.

Overall, this Premium Travel Yoga Mat is the perfect companion for yogis on the go. Its lightweight design, non-slip surface, and eco-friendly materials make it an excellent addition to any yoga practice. While it may not provide as much cushioning as some other mats, its numerous benefits more than make up for this downside.

### [Sustainable Jute Yoga Mat for Practicing all Yoga Types](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="premium-non-slip-yoga-mat-sustainable-jute-natural-rubber-ethical-eco-yoga-exercise-mat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/premium-non-slip-yoga-mat-sustainable-jute-natural-rubber-ethical-eco-yoga-exercise-mat-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using this Premium Non-Slip Yoga Mat, I can honestly say that it has been a game-changer in my yoga and fitness routine. The first thing that caught my eye was its unique design, combining jute fibers and natural tree rubber, which not only looks cool but also provides excellent grip. This is especially important for beginners like me, who tend to slip and slide during yoga practice.

The second feature that I absolutely love is how eco-friendly this mat is. It's made from 100% sustainably harvested natural tree rubber and precision woven natural jute fibers, which means it's not only good for the environment but also safe for me and my family. Plus, the fact that it's non-toxic (plastic-free, PU-free, BPA-free, TPE-free, PVC-free, and free from microfibre) is a huge plus.

In terms of comfort, this mat does not disappoint. With 4mm of cushioning, it provides optimal protection for my joints while still being thin enough to easily roll up and transport - perfect for on-the-go yogis like myself. And when it comes to cleaning, a simple wipe with a gentle vinegar and warm water solution does the trick.

There are a few minor cons worth mentioning. Some users have reported a strong rubber smell during the first month, but this usually fades over time. Additionally, the extra thickness may take some time to get used to if you're switching from a thinner mat.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my Premium Non-Slip Yoga Mat. It's perfect for all levels of yoga, pilates, fitness, and workouts, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their practice while also being gentle on the planet.

## Buyer's Guide

### Important Features of Jute Yoga Mats

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jute+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Jute Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

Jute yoga mats are growing in popularity due to their eco-friendly materials and comfortable feel. However, not all jute mats are created equal. When shopping for a jute mat, consider the following features:

- Thickness- Thicker mats provide more cushioning for knees and elbows during practice. Look for mats that are at least 5mm thick for optimal support.

- Non-Slip Surface- Jute's natural texture allows for better traction during yoga. Ensure the mat you choose has a textured surface that prevents sliding during poses.

- Size- Choose a mat large enough to comfortably accommodate your entire body during practice. Standard sizes range from 68" to 72" long and 24" to 26" wide.

### Considerations Before Purchasing a Jute Yoga Mat

Before buying a jute yoga mat, consider these factors:

1. Cleaning- Jute mats require special care when cleaning. Make sure to use a gentle cleaner and avoid soaking the mat to prevent mildew or damage.

2. Durability- Jute mats can wear out faster than synthetic alternatives. Look for mats with reinforced edges and good stitching to ensure longevity.

3. Smell- Some jute mats may have a strong odor initially. Choose a mat from a reputable brand with good reviews to minimize unpleasant smells.

### General Advice on Using Jute Yoga Mats

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your jute yoga mat:

- Air Out Your Mat- Jute mats can develop an unpleasant odor if stored tightly rolled. Allow your mat to air out after each use to keep it smelling fresh.

- Clean Regularly- Wipe down your mat after every practice session using a damp cloth and mild soap. Regular cleaning will help maintain its quality and longevity.

- Store Properly- When not in use, roll up your mat with the jute side facing outwards. This prevents moisture buildup and keeps your mat clean and dry.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between jute yoga mats and regular yoga mats?

Jute yoga mats are made from natural fibers of jute plant, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional rubber or PVC mats. They are lightweight, have good grip, and are biodegradable, making them a popular choice among environmentally conscious yogis.

### How do I clean my jute yoga mat?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jute+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Jute Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

To clean your jute yoga mat, first, dust off any dirt or debris. Then, mix equal parts water and white vinegar to create a cleaning solution. Dampen a soft cloth or sponge with the solution and gently wipe your mat. Let it air dry completely before rolling it up.

### How long do jute yoga mats last?

Jute yoga mats are quite durable and can last for several years with proper care. To prolong their lifespan, avoid exposing them to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, and clean them regularly with gentle cleaning methods.

### Are jute yoga mats slippery?

Jute yoga mats can be slightly slippery when brand new. However, with normal use, the texture will soften and provide a better grip. Adding a yoga towel or wearing non-slip socks can also enhance the grip while practicing yoga.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jute+Yoga+Mats-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Jute Yoga Mats-5"></a></div>

### Do jute yoga mats have a strong odor?

Jute yoga mats may have a mild natural odor due to the fibers. This odor usually dissipates within a few uses. Airing out the mat after each practice session can help eliminate the smell faster.

### Can I use my jute yoga mat outdoors?

While jute yoga mats are environmentally friendly, they are not recommended for outdoor use. Exposure to direct sunlight and extreme temperatures may damage the fibers and reduce their lifespan. Use a dedicated outdoor yoga mat or a towel to practice outdoors on the grass or sand.

### How thick should my jute yoga mat be?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jute-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jute+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Jute Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

Jute yoga mats come in various thicknesses, typically ranging from 3mm to 6mm. A 3mm mat provides light cushioning and is suitable for travel. A 4mm or 5mm mat offers more cushioning and support for daily practice, while a 6mm mat is thicker and offers greater support for those with joint issues or injuries.

### How do I store my jute yoga mat?

- Lay your mat flat or roll it up with the bottom side facing outwards to prevent crinkling or creasing.

- Avoid rolling or folding the mat too tightly, as this can damage the fibers.

- Choose a cool, dry place to store your mat, away from direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.

### How much do jute yoga mats cost?

The cost of jute yoga mats can vary depending on factors such as thickness, size, and quality. Generally, they range from $20 to $60, with premium mats costing higher due to added features such as straps, carrying cases, or extra cushioning.
