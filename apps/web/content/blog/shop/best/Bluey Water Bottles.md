### [Zak Designs Bluey 14oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle - Leak-Proof, Non-Skid Base, Insulated for Kids](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/bluey-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/bluey-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="zak-designs-14oz-stainless-steel-kids-water-bottle-with-antimicrobial-spout-bluey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/zak-designs-14oz-stainless-steel-kids-water-bottle-with-antimicrobial-spout-bluey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I got my hands on the Zak Designs 14oz Stainless Steel Kids' Water Bottle with Antimicrobial Spout Bluey, I was immediately taken by its vibrant design - it's certainly a head-turner! The non-skid base has been particularly useful in ensuring that the bottle doesn't slide around during my daily commute, which is a definite pro. The vacuum insulation feature is the real star here. It keeps my morning coffee hot and refreshes me with ice-cold water during the sweltering afternoon.

One downside, however, is that it tends to be quite heavy when filled up to its 14oz capacity. The leak-proof lid, albeit super convenient, sometimes requires a bit more effort to open than I'd like, particularly when I'm thirsty and in a hurry. But overall, this bottle has been an awesome companion on my daily adventures, keeping my beverages at the right temperature while adding a touch of fun and nostalgia to my daily routine.

Alright folks, let me tell you about my experience with this Bluey water bottle from Zak Designs. First of all, the artwork is absolutely adorable, my little ones love it! Plus, it comes with a sliding lock that makes sure the bottle stays shut tight when not in use.

The best part? It's a double wall vacuum insulated bottle, which means your cold drinks will stay chilly-cool for a long period of time! No more lukewarm water halfway through the day. And you won't find any pesky condensation rings on your tables or [desks](https://best.serp.co/shop/desks/) either.

One little issue though - despite claiming to be leak-proof, we found that it does let out a tiny bit of moisture under the lid if you're not careful while closing. But hey, nothing major!

Now, onto cleaning. This bottle isn't dishwasher safe, so get ready to do some hand washing. But honestly, considering how sturdy and reliable this product is, I don't mind a little extra effort.

All in all, if you're looking for a fun, functional, and high-quality water bottle for your kids, then you can't go wrong with this Bluey beauty!

- Stay Hydrated: Use your Bluey Water Bottle to maintain proper hydration levels throughout the day. Keep the bottle easily accessible and sip water regularly, especially during hot weather or while engaging in strenuous activities.

- Choose the Right Lid: Select a lid design that best suits your needs and preferences. Consider factors such as ease of use, leak-proof capabilities, and compatibility with car cup holders or bike mounts when making your choice.
