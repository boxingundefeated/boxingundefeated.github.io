[I recently got my hands on the Haven Athletic Large Duffel, a versatile bag designed for powerlifters, bodybuilders, boxers, and triathletes.](https://best.serp.co/shop/duffle-bag/) As someone who regularly switches between these sports and needs a bag that can handle all of my gear, I can say this bag has been a game-changer for me.

The first thing that stood out to me was the super convenient storage options. The various compartments and pockets make it easy for me to keep my gym clothes separate from my [boxing gloves](https://best.serp.co/shop/boxing-gloves/) and my protein shake. It's like having a personal assistant dedicated to making sure I never lose anything or end up with smelly socks in my bag!

Now, let's talk about size. This Large Duffel truly lives up to its name. I could practically live out of this thing for a week if I had to—not that I'd want to because it's so well made! The heavy-duty materials used in its construction ensure that it can withstand even the toughest workout sessions without showing signs of wear.

However, one downside of its large capacity is that it can sometimes feel a bit bulky when I'm carrying it around. But hey, you can't expect perfection from an already near-perfect bag!

As for its visual appeal, I'm a big fan of the sleek design and the range of colors available. It looks professional and stylish, which is important to me since I often go straight from the gym to meet friends or head to work.

In conclusion, the Haven Athletic Large Duffel has quickly become my go-to bag for any workout or sporting event.

### [Protg 20'' Collapsible Sports and Travel Duffel Bag](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers)

I recently took a family vacation to the beach, and with more luggage than I could carry, the Protg 20 inch Collapsible Sport and Travel Duffel Bag came to the rescue. This innovative bag not only has plenty of space for my belongings, but when it's not in use, it collapses flat for easy storage. The material is lightweight, making it perfect for those long haul trips and it even came with a packing cube - talk about convenience!

The Protg Duffel has a stylish design and color combination that is easy on the eyes. The various compartments, especially the mesh one on the side, made it super easy to organize my items. And let's not forget about the adjustable shoulder strap that was incredibly comfortable, even when the bag was packed to the brim.

There were a few minor cons though. While the material felt sturdy, I would have preferred if it was a bit thicker to handle heavier loads. Also, the zippers could have been a little smoother and quieter when opening and closing the bag.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I can say with certainty that the Protg 20 inch Collapsible Sport and Travel Duffel Bag is definitely worth considering for anyone who needs a stylish, compact, and versatile bag.

### [Stylish Fila Kelly 19-inch Duffel Bag](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers"><img alt="fila-kelly-19-in-sports-duffel-bag-stripe-static-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fila-kelly-19-in-sports-duffel-bag-stripe-static-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid swimmer, I was on the lookout for a stylish and functional gym bag. I stumbled upon the Fila Kelly 19-in Sports Duffel Bag Stripe Static Pink while browsing online, and it immediately caught my eye. With its stripe pattern and vibrant pink color, it definitely stands out in the crowd of black or navy gym bags.

What I absolutely adore about this bag is its spacious main compartment. It's like a Tardis inside - you can pack a bunch of clothes, shoes, towels, and even your swim gear all in one place without feeling cramped. And let's not forget the adjustable strap, which makes carrying this bag around super comfortable, even when it's filled to the brim.

One really clever feature is the side mesh pocket. It's perfect for holding wet or damp swimwear or workout gear, allowing air circulation to keep things fresh. Plus, there are multiple compartments to store smaller items like keys, wallet, and phone separately from your sweaty gym wear.

However, one area where I think the Fila Kelly Duffel Bag could improve is with its zipper. While it's reliable and smooth most of the time, I did find myself struggling to close it at times, especially when the bag was fully loaded.

In conclusion, the Fila Kelly 19-in Sports Duffel Bag Stripe Static Pink has become my go-to gym bag.

I recently got my hands on the Protege Duffel - Blue, and I'm more than happy with my purchase. This 18-inch duffel is made from 420D rip-stop polyester, which is quite durable for its size. One of the things I love about this bag is its U-shaped zippered main compartment that allows me to easily access my stuff. Plus, there's also a front zipper pocket and two side mesh pockets for additional storage.

Now, let's talk about the straps. This duffel has two webbing handles and one adjustable, detachable strap. I mostly use the handles when I'm carrying a lighter load, but I appreciate that I can use the detachable strap for added support when needed.

Overall, the Protege Duffel has been a game-changer for me. It's spacious enough for all my gym essentials, and its lightweight design makes it easy to carry around. The quality of the material and construction is evident, and I believe this bag will serve me well for a long time.

### [Deluxe Swim Backpack with Wet/Dry Pockets](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers"><img alt="kiefer-deluxe-swim-backpack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kiefer-deluxe-swim-backpack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Kiefer Deluxe Swim Backpack for about a month now and it's quickly become my go-to bag for swimming. The first thing that stood out to me was how spacious it is. I can fit all my swim gear in there, including my wet towel and suit, without any issues.

The exterior storage is a game-changer. I don't have to worry about my keys or phone getting wet or sandy because there's a zipped pocket with a hole for earbuds. The padded straps and cushioned back make it comfortable to carry, even when it's packed full.

On the downside, the wet/dry pocket could be a bit larger. Sometimes, I find myself struggling to fit everything in there. Also, while the exterior is water-resistant, the bottom isn't, so I have to be careful not to put it down on wet surfaces.

Overall, the Kiefer Deluxe Swim Backpack is a high-quality, versatile bag that's perfect for swimmers. Its convenient storage design, durability, and stylish appearance make it a winning choice.

### [Waterproof 17L Swim Backpack for Beach or Pool](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers"><img alt="athletic-works-waterproof-17l-mesh-swim-backpack-with-drawstring-red-black-size-one-size-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/athletic-works-waterproof-17l-mesh-swim-backpack-with-drawstring-red-black-size-one-size-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Athletic Works Waterproof Swim Bag has been largely positive. As an avid swimmer, I love how this bag not only keeps my belongings dry but also has a sleek sporty design that's easy to carry around. Highlight features for me include its capacity - it can fit all my essentials comfortably, from towels and swimsuits to my wallet and phone. The mesh front pocket is a convenient touch for quick access to my keys or goggles.

One thing to note though, is that the bag doesn't have insulation, so while it's perfect for keeping things dry, it doesn't keep them warm. Nevertheless, it's a solid option for poolside trips, beach outings, and even camping trips.

The material feels durable and lightweight, making it comfortable to carry even when fully loaded. Plus, the innovative drawstring system secures your belongings effectively, so you don't need to worry about items falling out. The color and design add to the bag's visual appeal, making it a stylish accessory too.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Athletic Works Waterproof Swim Bag. It's well-made, versatile, and does what it promises - keeping my stuff dry even in the harshest conditions.

Swimming is an invigorating workout, but it requires a lot of gear, from goggles to swim caps, swimsuits, and swim fins.
