### [1.0L Flexible Water Bottle with Push-Pull Cap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-softbottle-1-0l-waves-push-pull-cap-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-softbottle-1-0l-waves-push-pull-cap-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

There's this innovative water bottle called the Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L that I got my hands on recently. If you were to ask me what was unique about it, it's the lightweight and flexible design. This is not your regular bulky bottle; it's as simple as that.

I have a small apartment with limited storage, and the Platypus SoftBottle's compact form when empty is gold for me. Besides, the ridged center means I get a better grip when filling it with water. Once I'm done, it flattens effortlessly for easy storage, saving me precious space. Plus, the bottle is made from taste-free, BPA-free materials, so my drinking water remains just that - water!

The bottle comes with a choice between a Closure Cap or a Push-Pull Cap, and they both thread easily onto the bottle. I sometimes use these bottles with my Platypus drink tube, and it works just fine. But that's the positive side of it.

Now for some downsides. After using this bottle for quite some time, I did encounter a small leakage issue near the top seam. I was pretty disappointed as this was not something I was expecting from such a trusted brand. Additionally, I should mention that the bottle threads are not compatible with a regular Sawyer squeeze filter, which was a minor inconvenience.

Although I had hoped for a leak-free and thread-compatible bottle, I will still recommend this product. I mean, it does make it easier for me to carry water around, especially while traveling or hiking. And let's not forget, the compact size when empty is perfect for someone like me who's always tight on space.

Here's my take on the Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L - it's an ingenious water bottle that's perfect for travelers and hikers. Yes, there are minor issues that could be improved, but the benefits far outweigh them. If you're like me and value the space-saving design and lightweight nature of this bottle, it's worth giving it a try.

### [Platypus Big Zip EVO - 3 Liter High-Flow Water Reservoir](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-big-zip-evo-3-liter-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-big-zip-evo-3-liter-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular hiker and camper, I've been using the Platypus Big Zip Evo for quite some time now, and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of hydration systems. The low profile design fits seamlessly in my backpack, making it a perfect companion for long hikes or backpacking trips.

What really stands out is the wide mouth opening. Filling up the 3-liter reservoir with water or ice is an absolute breeze, even when you're on the go. The Big Zip secure closure ensures that there are no leaks or spills, giving me peace of mind as I tramp through the wilderness.

One of my favorite features is the quick disconnect hose with an auto shut-off. This innovative design prevents water from leaking out of the hose when I detach it from the reservoir, making refilling and cleaning a hassle-free process.

The Silver Ion Antimicrobial technology keeps the reservoir fresh and odor-free, even after multiple uses. I've been using it for weeks without noticing any unpleasant smells or tastes.

However, there are some cons to consider. Some users have experienced issues with the hose kinking, which can be frustrating when you desperately need a sip of water. Additionally, the bite valve can be a little aggressive, occasionally pinching my tongue.

All things considered, the Platypus Big Zip Evo has been a reliable and efficient hydration system for my outdoor adventures. Its unique features and high-quality construction make it a top choice for hikers, backpackers, and mountain bikers alike.

### [Platypus Platy 2-Liter Ultralight Collapsible Water Bottle for Camping and Travel](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-platy-2-liter-ultralight-collapsible-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-platy-2-liter-ultralight-collapsible-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Platypus Platy 2-Liter Ultralight [Collapsible Water Bottle](https://best.serp.co/shop/collapsible-water-bottle/) has been a game-changer in my outdoor adventures. It's incredibly lightweight, portable, and perfect for camping, hiking, or travel. This innovative design is not only environmentally friendly but also incredibly reliable.

One of the things I love about the Platy Bottle is its collapsibility. When it's not in use, I can roll it up and st Ash it in my pocket, which is a massive plus when I'm trying to reduce weight and space. Despite its lightweight nature, it's surprisingly durable. I've had mine for several seasons now, and it's showing no signs of wear and tear.

Another thing worth mentioning is that it's BPA-, BPS-, and phthalate-free, with a food-grade polyethylene lining. I'm always worried about plastic tases, but there's absolutely no plastic taste to the water when I use this bottle. Plus, it doesn't retain any flavors, so no matter what I put in it, the taste remains fresh and clean.

On the downside, I've noticed that the bottle is a little difficult to clean. The collapsible design makes reaching every corner challenging. However, this is a small inconvenience compared to its many other benefits.

In conclusion, the Platypus Platy 2-Liter Ultralight Collapsible Water Bottle is a brilliant addition to any adventurer's gear. Its lightweight, durable design and clean taste make it a reliable companion for all your outdoor escapades. Although there are some minor inconveniences, such as cleaning difficulties, these are outweighed by its numerous advantages.

### [Platypus GravityWorks 4.0L Water Reservoir Kit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-gravityworks-4-0l-replacement-reservoir-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-gravityworks-4-0l-replacement-reservoir-kit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Platypus GravityWorks Water Filter System, and I have to say, it's a game-changer for outdoor enthusiasts who love to stay hydrated on-the-go! As a avid camper and hiker, I've tried numerous water filter systems over the years, but the GravityWorks has blown me away with its ease of use and speed.

In my experience, setting up this system is incredibly simple; just fill the dirty reservoir with water, attach the filter, and let gravity do the rest. The 4L capacity is perfect for larger groups or longer trips, and in just 2.5 minutes, you can have four liters of safe, filtered water without any pumping required. This was especially helpful during a recent camping trip where I didn't have to worry about keeping track of how much water I was consuming or when it was time to refill.

One feature that stands out to me is the unique, dual-layer laminate design of the reservoirs. The rugged exterior provides durability and protection, while the taste-free interior ensures that my water always tastes fresh and clean. Additionally, the compact size of the system (15 x 8 inches) and light weight (6 ounces) make it easy to pack and transport, even on extended adventures.

However, I did encounter a few minor issues with the Platypus GravityWorks Water Filter System. Firstly, I found that the clean reservoir was difficult to dry and clean due to its small soda cap opening. This made proper drying and mildew prevention challenging, which led to more frequent cleaning than I would have liked. Secondly, I feel that the cost of the replacement reservoir kit is relatively high, especially considering that it only includes a couple of water bags.

In conclusion, the Platypus GravityWorks Water Filter System has significantly improved my outdoor water filtration experience. Its ease of use, speed, and capacity make it an ideal choice for adventurers who value convenience and efficiency in their gear. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as the difficulty in cleaning and drying the clean reservoir and the relatively high cost of the replacement kit, these issues do not outweigh the overall benefits the system provides.

### [Platypus Drink Tube Kit for Hoser Reservoirs](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-drink-tube-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-drink-tube-kit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Platypus Drink Tube Kit for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my outdoorsy lifestyle. This hose kit is incredibly versatile, making any Platypus bottle turn into an ultra-light bladder or camp reservoir. It's not just for the Hoser reservoirs; it also works with Platypus products that have a screw thread.

One of the features that I absolutely love is the bite valve. It's so easy to use and doesn't drip, leaving me dry when I'm not taking a sip. The drinking hose is made from durable plastic, and it has a fresh, appealing color. Plus, with strict quality control, I can trust that this product will last me for a long time.

However, there's a downside to this otherwise excellent product. Many users, including myself, have experienced a strong plastic taste, even after washing it and using it a few times. The taste can be quite overwhelming initially, but it does diminish gradually over time.

Overall, I would recommend the Platypus Drink Tube Kit to anyone looking to upgrade their hydration system. It's a convenient and efficient solution that turns any Platypus bottle into a versatile and functional hydration bladder, perfect for camping, hiking, and other outdoor adventures.

### [Fast and Easy Gravity-fed Water Filter System with 4-Liter Capacity](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages"><img alt="platypus-gravityworks-4-0l-water-filter-system-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-gravityworks-4-0l-water-filter-system-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Platypus GravityWorks 4.0L Water Filter System and let me tell you, it has revolutionized my camping trips! This filter system requires no pumping and can deliver four liters of filtered water in just 2.5 minutes. The ease of use is unbeatable; simply fill the dirty reservoir with water, hang it above the clean water reservoir, and let gravity do its work. The system comes with two 4-liter reservoirs, one for dirty water and one for clean water. The dirty reservoir even features a quick-disconnect valve that automatically shuts off the flow of water when the hose is disconnected. Plus, the GravityWorks reservoirs have hang loops for easy in-camp use.

One of the best features of this filter system is its ability to remove 99.9999% of bacteria and 99.9% of protozoa, all while meeting EPA and NSF guidelines. The filter pore size is an impressive 0.2 microns, ensuring that your water is safe and clean. Additionally, the filter has a lifespan of up to 1500L if filtering clear water, making it perfect for larger groups.

Another aspect I love about the Platypus GravityWorks 4.0L Water Filter System is how easy it is to maintain. The dirty reservoir can simply be backflushed to remove any sediment and maintain the filtration rate. And the SlimeGuard antimicrobial treatment used on the reservoirs ensures that the water has a taste-free performance.

While there's a lot to love about the Platypus GravityWorks 4.0L Water Filter System, there are a few things to consider before making a purchase. First, the filtering speed is not the fastest compared to some other systems, so it may take a bit of time to get your supply of filtered water. Additionally, if you're using the system with visibly murky water, you'll need to perform more backflushing, which can add to the overall filtering time.

Despite these minor cons, I wholeheartedly recommend the Platypus GravityWorks 4.0L Water Filter System to anyone in need of a reliable and easy-to-use water filtration system for their outdoor adventures. It's an excellent investment that will make your camping trips much more enjoyable and stress-free when it comes to finding clean water sources. Happy adventuring!

One feature that really stands out is its built-in filter which reduces chlorine for a cleaner, fresher taste. It's a game-changer for those who can't stand the taste of tap water but prefer not to waste money on disposable plastic bottles.

However, there are a few drawbacks. Some users found the filter difficult to replace, and others criticized the bottle's leakiness. It's also worth noting that the filter is not suitable for dishwashers, but that's a small price to pay for clean drinking water.

Overall, the Philips Water 22oz GoZero Everyday Tritan Plastic Bottle with Filter offers a convenient, eco-friendly solution for hydration on-the-go. [Whether you're headed to the gym, office, or out for a hike, this bottle will keep you hydrated with clean, refreshing water.](https://gist.github.com/bestappsandcodereviews18/b54f5a0cb2f27845f27005c393f1ab49)

### [Collapsible Platypus Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/platypus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ghpages)

The added SlimeGuard antimicrobial treatment gives me peace of mind, knowing that my bottle is protected from bacteria and contamination.

One feature that really stands out is the bottle's ability to stand upright when full, which is a nice touch that I haven't seen in other water bottles. It's also worth mentioning that the Platy Plus Bottle is ultra-reusable and lightweight, making it a more environmentally friendly choice compared to traditional hard plastic bottles.

However, there are a few downsides to this bottle that I should mention. First, the opening is quite small, which can make it difficult to fill with ice or add sports drinks to. Additionally, the push-pull cap can be a bit cumbersome to open and close, especially when your hands are dirty or wet.

But overall, I've been incredibly happy with my Platypus Platy Plus Bottle. It's lightweight, durable, and designed to make hydration on-the-go easy and convenient. If you're in the market for a new water bottle, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

First off, let's talk about the capacity of the system. Its ability to hold up to 6 liters of dirty water and produce filtered water at a rate of 1.75 liters per minute is quite impressive. It's perfect for camping trips, hiking, and even emergency preparedness situations.

One feature that really stood out for me was the replaceable cartridge filters.

However, on the downside, it's worth mentioning that some users have reported issues with the filter's reliability and lifespan.

As for the ease of use, the Platypus GravityWorks is definitely top-notch. All you need to do is fill the dirty reservoir, hang it up, and let gravity do its thing.

In terms of portability, this water filter system is a winner. It's super lightweight, weighing only 11.5 ounces, and can easily be stored in a compact storage sack. It's perfect for taking on the go and won't weigh you down during your outdoor adventures.
