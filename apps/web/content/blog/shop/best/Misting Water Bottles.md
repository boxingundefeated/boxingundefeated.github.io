The first is that the thin straw responsible for the mister is a bit fragile and could potentially break with frequent use. I've been treating it gently to extend its lifespan. Secondly, the bottle isn't as robust as some, so if you're prone to dropping things, you might want to consider a more sturdy option.

Overall, the O2cool Mist 'n Sip offers a refreshing twist to the traditional water bottle and I'm glad I found it. Its ability to mist and keep my drinks cold for extended periods makes it a must-have gadget for hot summer days.
