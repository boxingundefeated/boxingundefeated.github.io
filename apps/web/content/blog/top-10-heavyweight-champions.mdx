# Top 10 Greatest Heavyweight Champions of All Time

The heavyweight division has always been the glamour division in boxing. These giants of the ring have captivated audiences for over a century. Today, we're counting down the top 10 greatest heavyweight champions in boxing history.

## 10. Jack Dempsey (1919-1926)

**Record:** 66-6-11 (51 KOs)

**Record:** 44-10-2 (29 KOs)

The "Easton Assassin" had one of the best jabs in heavyweight history. He made 20 successful title defenses and went 48-0 before his first loss.

## 7. George Foreman (1973-1974, 1994-1997)

**Record:** 76-5 (68 KOs)
