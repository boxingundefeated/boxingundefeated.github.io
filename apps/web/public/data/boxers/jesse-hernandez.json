With a long reach of 68½ inches, Hernandez can keep his opponents at a distance, making it difficult for them to get close enough to land a clean shot. This allows him to control the pace of the fight and dictate the action inside the ring.</p>\n\n<p>But Hernandez's success in the ring is not the only reason he has gained popularity among boxing fans. He is also known for his charismatic and engaging personality. Whether he's trash-talking his opponents in pre-fight interviews or showing off his dance moves during his ring entrances, he knows how to entertain the crowd and keep them engaged.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the ring, Hernandez is a devoted family man and a role model for aspiring young boxers. He often speaks at local events and schools, encouraging kids to stay away from drugs and violence and to pursue their dreams.
