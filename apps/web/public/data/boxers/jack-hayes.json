He rarely indulges in trash talk or seeks attention from the media, preferring to let his actions in the ring speak for themselves. This, combined with his notoriously disciplined lifestyle, has granted him the nickname \"The Silent Assassin\" - a title that perfectly encapsulates his quiet yet lethal approach to his craft.</p>\n\n<p>Hayes' impact on the sport extends beyond his in-ring performances. His dedication to his training and his unwavering commitment to his craft serve as an inspiration to aspiring boxers around the world.
