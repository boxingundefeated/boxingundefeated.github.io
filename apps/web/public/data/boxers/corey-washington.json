With a reach of 81 inches (206cm) and an orthodox stance, Washington brings a formidable presence to every fight he enters.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at 6'6\" tall, Washington's reach gives him a significant advantage in his bouts. With those long arms, he can keep his opponents at a distance and deliver devastating jabs and hooks. It's like trying to get past a brick wall when facing Washington in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Washington's orthodox stance also plays a crucial role in his boxing style. By positioning his left foot forward and his right foot back, he has stability and balance that allows him to generate power in his punches. This stance also makes it easier for him to defend against his opponents' attacks.</p>\n\n<p>While Washington's physical attributes give him an edge, it's his training and experience that truly set him apart. With over 20 years of boxing experience, he has honed his skills and developed a strategic approach to the sport.</p>\n\n<p>Washington's trainers have focused on developing his natural strengths, utilizing his reach to its full potential. They've taught him how to use his long arms to control the distance in the ring, keeping his opponents on the backfoot and unable to mount an effective offense.</p>\n\n<p>His trainers have also emphasized footwork and defensive techniques, ensuring that Washington is not only capable of delivering powerful blows but also adept at avoiding his opponents' punches. By weaving, bobbing, and using quick lateral movements, Washington can keep himself out of harm's way while setting up his own attacks.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to his physical attributes and training, Washington's mental strength is another factor that plays a crucial role in his success as a boxer. He possesses a resolute determination and an unwavering self-belief, which allow him to push through tough moments in a fight and never give up.</p>\n\n<p>One of Washington's greatest assets is his ability to adapt to different opponents and fight styles. He studies his opponents carefully, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and adjusting his strategy accordingly. This adaptability has served him well throughout his career, allowing him to overcome challenges and emerge victorious.</p>\n\n<p>Washington's overall fighting style can be described as calculated and analytical. He doesn't rely solely on brute force; instead, he uses his reach and footwork to create openings for precise and accurate punches. Every move he makes in the ring is purposeful, and he doesn't waste energy on unnecessary motions.</p>\n\n<p>When Washington steps into the ring, he brings with him a quiet confidence and a burning desire to win. He understands that victory is not guaranteed, that it's earned through hard work and dedication. This mentality pushes him to give his all in every training session and fight, and it's what has led him to achieve success in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>While he may not have the flashy nicknames or the headline-grabbing antics of some boxers, Corey Washington's skills and determination make him a force to be reckoned with. His combination of physical attributes, training, adaptability, and mental strength set him apart in the boxing world. Washington may be a silent warrior, but his victories in the ring speak volumes.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"2009-03-26","proDivision":"middle","proWins":3,"proWinsByKnockout":1,"proLosses":7,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":1,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":11,"proTotalRounds":44,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":44,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:45.206683","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:45.206685","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\":
