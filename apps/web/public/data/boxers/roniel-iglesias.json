His punches are precise and carry a significant impact, often leaving his opponents stunned. His footwork is smooth and agile, allowing him to navigate the ring with ease and set up his attacks brilliantly.</p>\n\n<p>What sets Iglesias apart from other boxers is his ability to adapt to different fighting styles. He is adept at analyzing his opponents' strengths and weaknesses and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Whether he is facing an aggressive brawler or a technical counterpuncher, Iglesias has the versatility to navigate any challenge that comes his way.</p>\n\n<p>His fighting style can be likened to that of a chess player, constantly assessing his opponent's moves and making calculated decisions to outmaneuver them.
