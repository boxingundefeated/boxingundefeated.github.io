Standing at an impressive height of 196 centimeters and boasting a reach of 204 centimeters, Fa has the physical attributes of a true heavyweight contender. With an orthodox stance and the ability to throw powerful punches from various angles, he poses a formidable challenge to his opponents in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Although not known for any specific nickname, Fa's skills and performances inside the squared circle have earned him respect among boxing enthusiasts. His journey in the sport began at a young age, and over the years, he has fine-tuned his technique and honed his boxing skills to become a formidable force in the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>Fa's boxing career is testament to his dedication and hard work. As a heavyweight fighter, he competes in a weight class known for its power and knockout potential. With every bout, Fa aims to showcase his skills and prove that he has what it takes to compete at the highest level of the sport.</p>\n\n<p>One of the defining features of Fa's boxing style is his impressive reach. With a wingspan of 204 centimeters, he has the ability to keep his opponents at a distance and land powerful punches from the outside. This reach advantage allows him to dictate the pace of the fight and control the distance between himself and his opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect that sets Fa apart from other heavyweights is his orthodox stance. This means that his left foot is positioned forward, allowing him to throw stronger right-hand punches and deliver devastating blows to his opponents. The combination of his reach and orthodox stance makes him a formidable opponent in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>As with any heavyweight boxer, Fa possesses the power to end a fight with a single punch. His punches pack a tremendous amount of force, and when they land on target, they can change the course of a fight in an instant. This knockout power, combined with his technical skills, makes Fa a dangerous fighter and a threat to anyone in the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>Winning in the heavyweight division requires more than just physical attributes and knockout power. It also demands strategic thinking and the ability to adapt to different opponents. Fa has shown his versatility and flexibility inside the ring, constantly adjusting his game plan based on the style and strengths of his adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his height and reach advantages, Fa understands that in order to be successful, he must continue to refine his skills and work on his weaknesses. This dedication to constant improvement is what separates good fighters from great ones, and Fa has demonstrated a strong work ethic and a desire to reach the top of the heavyweight rankings.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Fa has faced tough competition and has tested his skills against some of the best heavyweights in the world. This experience has allowed him to learn and grow as a boxer, gaining valuable insights that will undoubtedly benefit him in future fights.</p>\n\n<p>At only 32 years old, Fa still has many years of boxing ahead of him. As he continues to train, develop his skills, and gain more experience, the boxing world can expect to see him rise through the ranks and contend for world titles.</p>\n\n<p>A fighter's career is not without its setbacks and challenges. Fa has had to overcome obstacles and setbacks along the way, but these experiences have only made him stronger and more determined. It is often said that the true measure of a fighter is how they respond to adversity, and Fa has shown resilience and a never-give-up attitude throughout his journey.</p>\n\n<p>Looking into the future, it will be exciting to see what lies ahead for Junior Fa. With his physical attributes, technical skills, and dedication to the sport, he has the potential to make a significant impact in the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>As boxing fans, we eagerly anticipate the next chapter in Fa's career. Will he continue to climb the rankings and face off against some of the division's biggest names? Only time will tell. But one thing is for certain: Junior Fa is a force to be reckoned with, and his boxing journey is far from over.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"2016-02-13","proDivision":"heavy","proWins":20,"proWinsByKnockout":11,"proLosses":3,"proLossesByKnockout":2,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":23,"proTotalRounds":103,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":103,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:35.732211","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:35.732219","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\":
