He has trained extensively to develop mental fortitude and resilience. This mental toughness allows him to remain calm and focused even in the face of adversity.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the ring, Hoffman is known for his humility and dedication. He is never one to boast or trash talk his opponents. Instead, he lets his actions do the talking inside the ring.
