His reach allows him to keep his foes at bay, making it difficult for them to close the distance and land their own punches.</p>\n\n<p>Barker's height is not just a physical attribute; it is the foundation of his boxing style. He uses it as a tool to control the pace and distance of the fight, frustrating his opponents and keeping them at bay with his jab.

With his long arms, he can strike from a distance where his opponents can't reach him, finding openings and exploiting them with remarkable precision.</p>\n\n<p>However, Barker's height also comes with its own set of challenges. His towering stature means he presents a larger target for his opponents to aim at, making it crucial for him to maintain his mobility and defensive skills.
