Solomons saw the potential in Marciano early on and played a pivotal role in his rise to fame. He not only secured him important fights but also ensured that his name reached a wider audience through strategic marketing and promotion.</p>\n\n<p>But Solomons' influence in the boxing world extended beyond just his promotional efforts.
