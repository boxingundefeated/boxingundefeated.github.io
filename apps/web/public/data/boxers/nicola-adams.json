From the heavyweight giants like Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson to the lightning-fast speed of fighters like Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr., there is no shortage of excitement in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>But let's not forget about the smaller weight classes, where a different kind of intensity and skill is showcased. One boxer who has made a name for herself in the flyweight division is Nicola Adams.</p>\n\n<p>Born on October 26, 1982, Adams is a force to be reckoned with in the ring. Standing at just 163cm tall, her stature may not intimidate opponents, but her skill and determination certainly do. With a reach of 164cm and an orthodox stance, Adams knows how to use her physical attributes to her advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Adams made her professional boxing debut in 2017, but her journey in boxing began long before that. She first stepped into the ring at the age of 12 and quickly discovered her passion for the sport. Over the years, she honed her skills and became a formidable amateur boxer.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Adams is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, having won in the women's flyweight division at the 2012 London Olympics and the 2016 Rio Olympics. This achievement alone speaks volumes about her talent and ability to perform under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Adams' success in the Olympics also opened doors for her in the professional boxing world. She became the first female boxer to sign with promoter Frank Warren and made a splash in her debut against Virginia Noemi Carcamo, winning by unanimous decision.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that sets Adams apart from the rest is her boxing style. Known for her quick hands and footwork, she has the ability to evade opponents' punches while delivering her own with precision. Her speed and agility allow her to dictate the pace of the fight and keep her opponents on their toes.</p>\n\n<p>As a flyweight boxer, Adams competes in the 112-pound weight class. This weight class is known for its fast-paced action and explosive combinations. While some may dismiss the flyweights for their smaller size, Adams proves time and time again that this division is just as exciting and competitive as any other.</p>\n\n<p>Adams' dedication to her craft is evident in her training routine. She spends hours in the gym, working on her boxing skills, conditioning her body, and studying her opponents. This level of commitment is what sets the best fighters apart from the rest, and Adams is no exception.</p>\n\n<p>But it's not just her skills inside the ring that make Adams a remarkable athlete. She is also a role model and advocate for inclusivity in sports. As an openly gay athlete, she has used her platform to raise awareness and support for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n\n<p>Adams' achievements in the sport of boxing have earned her numerous accolades and recognition. In addition to her Olympic gold medals, she has also won multiple World Championship titles and was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) for her services to boxing.</p>\n\n<p>As Adams continues to compete and make her mark on the boxing world, there is no doubt that she will be remembered as one of the greats in her weight class. Her skill, determination, and contributions to the sport make her an inspiration to both aspiring boxers and fans alike.</p>\n\n<p>So, the next time you tune into a boxing match, don't overlook the flyweight division. Keep an eye out for the lightning-fast Nicola Adams as she showcases her talent and adds to her collection of victories. She may be small in stature, but she is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with in the ring.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"2017-04-08","proDivision":"fly","proWins":5,"proWinsByKnockout":3,"proLosses":0,"proLossesByKnockout":0,"proDraws":1,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":6,"proTotalRounds":31,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":31,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:44.672224","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:44.672229","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2381850\", \"boutDate\": \"Sep 19\", \"opponentName\": \"Maria Salinas\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Royal Albert Hall, Kensington\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"draw\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/793677/2381850\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2269401\", \"boutDate\": \"Oct 18\", \"opponentName\": \"Isabel Millan\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Leicester Arena, Leicester\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/773489/2269401\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2241151\", \"boutDate\": \"May 18\", \"opponentName\": \"Soledad del Valle \\nFrias\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Elland Road Football Ground, Leeds\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/762276/2241151\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2205076\", \"boutDate\": \"Dec 17\", \"opponentName\": \"Soledad Macedo\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Place Bell, Laval\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/759012/2205076\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2136558\", \"boutDate\": \"May 17\", \"opponentName\": \"Maryan Salazar\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"First Direct Arena, Leeds\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/745700/2136558\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"787179\", \"boxrecId\": \"2136557\", \"boutDate\": \"Apr 17\", \"opponentName\": \"Virginia Noemi \\nCarcamo\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Manchester Arena, Manchester\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/745699/2136557\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}]"}
