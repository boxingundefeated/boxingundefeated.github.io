At 167.64cm, he has the ability to throw punches from a distance, keeping his opponents at bay. This reach advantage allows him to control the pace of the fight and dictate the distance between himself and his opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Being a southpaw, Sanchez has a distinct advantage over orthodox fighters.

This ability to close the distance quickly and effectively puts him in a dominant position in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Sanchez's burstiness also enables him to evade opponents' punches with ease. He has an uncanny ability to slip and weave out of the way of incoming punches and counter with lightning-fast combinations. This defensive skill, coupled with his offensive prowess, makes him a formidable opponent that is hard to read and predict.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to strategy, Sanchez is known for his precision and calculated approach. He studies his opponents meticulously, looking for weaknesses and patterns in their fighting style. Once he identifies these weaknesses, he capitalizes on them, exploiting every opportunity to land precise and devastating blows.</p>\n\n<p>A hallmark of Sanchez's approach is his ability to adapt and adjust his strategy mid-fight. He is not afraid to change his game plan if it means gaining an upper hand. This adaptability showcases his ring intelligence and highlights his ability to think on his feet and make split-second decisions.</p>\n\n<p>One area where Sanchez excels is his footwork. His agility and quick foot movement enable him to maintain superior balance and position himself effectively. This footwork, combined with his burstiness, allows him to quickly change angles and create opportunities to land powerful shots.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Raul Sanchez is a rising star in the world of boxing.
