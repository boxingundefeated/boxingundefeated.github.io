With his immense experience and skill in the ring, Gomez has carved a name for himself as one of the most formidable fighters in the sport. Although he may not have any specific nicknames associated with him, his accomplishments speak volumes about his capabilities as a boxer.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key factors that sets Gomez apart from his opponents is his reach. Standing at 65½ inches or 166cm tall, Gomez has a considerable advantage over many of his rivals. A longer reach enables him to land punches from a distance, keeping his opponents at bay while maintaining a strong offensive position. This attribute gives him the upper hand in many of his fights, allowing him to dictate the pace and control the distance in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Gomez has faced numerous challenges and consistently proven his mettle. His ability to adapt to different styles of opponents and utilize his reach effectively has played a significant role in his success. By utilizing his long reach to his advantage, he has been able to create opportunities to land powerful punches while minimizing the risks of being hit.</p>\n\n<p>Gomez's reach also grants him an advantage when it comes to defense. By keeping his opponents at a distance, he can create a buffer zone that makes it harder for them to land clean shots. This defensive strategy allows him to evade punches with relative ease, minimizing the impact of his opponents' offense and increasing his chances of counterattacking effectively. Gomez's reach, therefore, serves as both an offensive and defensive weapon in his arsenal.</p>\n\n<p>When analyzing Gomez's fights, his reach is a crucial factor to consider. His opponents often struggle to get within striking range without being met with a flurry of punches from Gomez. This creates a perplexing situation for his adversaries, as they must find a way to close the distance without leaving themselves vulnerable to his power punches. Gomez has mastered the art of using his reach to keep his opponents off balance and guessing, putting them in a constant state of perplexity.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Gomez's reach allows him to create burstiness in his attacks. Burstiness refers to the ability to deliver a series of rapid and powerful punches. With his long reach, Gomez can quickly close the gap between himself and his opponents, unleashing a rapid flurry of punches that often catches them off guard. This burst of offense can overwhelm his opponents, leaving them dazed and open to further attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Gomez's reach also enables him to control the pace of the fight. By utilizing his reach effectively, he can dictate the distance and tempo of the match. He can choose to keep the fight at a distance, frustrating his opponents with his long jabs and counters. Alternatively, he can close the distance and use his burstiness to launch aggressive offensive assaults. This versatility in his approach allows him to adapt to different opponents and fight situations effectively, making him a formidable force in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>With his reach as a key asset, Gomez has achieved remarkable success in his boxing career. He has consistently demonstrated his ability to utilize his reach as both a defensive and offensive weapon, confounding his opponents and securing victory. His long arms have become his trademark, leaving opponents perplexed and unable to find a way to neutralize his reach advantage.</p>\n\n<p>As Gomez continues his boxing journey, his reach will undoubtedly remain a crucial factor in his success. By leveraging this attribute, he will continue to dominate in the ring and leave his opponents in awe of his skills. Gomez has proven that the length of his reach is not just a physical attribute but a strategic weapon that he wields with precision and expertise.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1969-07-12","proDivision":"","proWins":2,"proWinsByKnockout":2,"proLosses":5,"proLossesByKnockout":4,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":7,"proTotalRounds":45,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":45,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:45.041271","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:45.041278"},{"id":"15818.0","boxrecId":"197565","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/197565","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"john-mcmahon","name":"John McMahon","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/build/images/main/v6-avatar.svg","residence":"Boston, Massachusetts, USA","birthPlace":null,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"USA","height":null,"reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>John McMahon: The Rising Star in Boxing</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the world of professional boxing, there are some athletes who possess a certain incomparable talent, charisma, and determination that sets them apart from the rest.

However, deep within the annals of boxing history lies a forgotten pioneer who played a crucial role in shaping the sport as we know it today—James Creighton.</p>\n\n<p>Though not as widely known as some of boxing's more famous figures, James Creighton's impact on the sport cannot be overstated. Born on April 15, 1841, in Caledonia, Ontario, Creighton exhibited a natural talent and passion for the sport from a young age. As he honed his skills in the boxing ring, he garnered a reputation as a formidable fighter and soon began making waves in the sporting world.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of Creighton's boxing career is his versatility. While many fighters focus on a specific weight class or boxing style, Creighton proved to be a true polymath, excelling at both bare-knuckle boxing and wrestling. His ability to adapt to different styles and weight divisions set him apart from his contemporaries, making him a force to be reckoned with in any arena.</p>\n\n<p>Creighton's contributions to the sport extended beyond his achievements as a boxer. In 1860, he became the first recognized heavyweight champion of Canada after defeating Tom Allen, an accomplishment that solidified his standing as one of the era's greatest fighters. He also introduced significant changes to the rules of the sport, advocating for the use of gloves and the introduction of timed rounds.</p>\n\n<p>But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Creighton's career was his role in introducing boxing to the United States. In the mid-1800s, boxing was still a relatively underground and unregulated sport in America. Recognizing the potential for growth and popularity, Creighton crossed the border and began showcasing his skills in the northern states.</p>\n\n<p>Creighton's exhibitions were met with awe and enthusiasm, attracting large crowds eager to witness the sport firsthand. He soon found himself at the forefront of a burgeoning boxing scene, instrumental in founding several clubs and organizations dedicated to the sport's promotion and regulation.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his undeniable talent and contributions to the sport, Creighton's career was cut tragically short. On October 18, 1863, during a bare-knuckle boxing match in Rochester, New York, Creighton sustained a fatal injury that would claim his life at the age of just 22. The tragic event sent shockwaves through the boxing community, leaving a void that would take years to fill.</p>\n\n<p>Although his life was tragically cut short, Creighton's impact on boxing did not fade away. His innovations and changes to the sport's rules laid the foundation for the modern era of boxing, shaping it into the dynamic and regulated sport we know today.</p>\n\n<p>When reflecting on the legacy of James Creighton, it's important to remember the pioneering spirit he embodied. He fearlessly pushed boundaries, challenged conventions, and dedicated his life to a sport that had yet to fully mature. His passion and contributions, though often overshadowed by more well-known figures, deserve recognition and celebration.</p>\n\n<p>Today, as we watch boxing matches in state-of-the-art arenas, study fighters' skills in slow-motion replays, and revel in the excitement of the sport, let us not forget James Creighton—the forgotten pioneer who helped pave the way for the sport we love.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1981-01-30","proDivision":"","proWins":0,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":1,"proTotalRounds":3,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":3,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:06.761328","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:06.761335"},{"id":"16297.0","boxrecId":"288229","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/288229","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"harry-sloan","name":"Harry Sloan","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/build/images/main/v6-avatar.svg","residence":"New York, USA","birthPlace":null,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"USA","height":null,"reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>Harry Sloan: The Heavyweight Powerhouse</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to boxing, there are few fighters who can match the sheer power and tenacity of Harry Sloan.

One such fighter who left a lasting impact on the sport is Albert Robinson. Born on June 18, 1947, Robinson made a name for himself in the featherweight division, standing at a height of 180cm with an orthodox stance.</p>\n\n<p>Although there may not be any recorded nicknames associated with Robinson, his accomplishments in the ring speak for themselves. As a featherweight boxer, Robinson competed in a weight class known for its speed and agility. This weight class typically includes fighters weighing between 57 kilograms (126 pounds) and 59 kilograms (130 pounds).</p>\n\n<p>Robinson's career spanned over several years, showcasing his skill and determination inside the squared circle. Throughout his boxing journey, he faced off against some of the most formidable opponents of his time, proving himself to be a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key factors that set Robinson apart was his orthodox stance. In boxing, fighters can either adopt an orthodox or a southpaw stance. An orthodox stance means that the boxer's left hand is their lead hand, while their right hand is their power hand. This stance allows for powerful right-hand punches and quick left jabs, which can catch opponents off guard.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at a height of 180cm, Robinson had the advantage of being able to deliver his punches from a higher vantage point, giving him greater reach and leverage. This height also allowed him to maintain a comfortable distance from his opponents, making it difficult for them to close the distance and land effective punches.</p>\n\n<p>The featherweight division is known for its speed and agility, with fighters often relying on quick footwork and swift combinations to outmaneuver their opponents. Throughout his career, Robinson showcased his agility by constantly moving in and out of range, making it challenging for his opponents to land clean shots.</p>\n\n<p>As a featherweight boxer, Robinson faced opponents who were not only physically skilled but also highly strategic in their approach. Each fight presented a unique challenge, requiring Robinson to adapt and come up with effective game plans to secure victory.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the ring, Robinson's skills were undeniable. He displayed exceptional hand speed, allowing him to unleash a flurry of punches in rapid succession. His precision and accuracy were also top-notch, as he often landed clean shots on his opponents' vulnerable areas.</p>\n\n<p>Robinson's ability to gauge distance and timing was another aspect that made him a formidable opponent. He had a keen sense of when to strike, effectively using his reach advantage to keep his opponents at bay or close in for a devastating blow.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Robinson faced both victories and defeats, as any boxer would. However, it is important to remember that boxing is not solely defined by wins and losses. It is the spirit of the sport, the determination to succeed, and the willingness to push oneself to the limit that truly matter.</p>\n\n<p>Even though there may not be any recorded nicknames associated with Albert Robinson, his legacy as a featherweight boxer endures. His career serves as a reminder of the dedication and commitment required to compete in the brutal yet thrilling world of boxing. Robinson's story inspires future generations of fighters to step into the ring, face their challenges head-on, and strive for greatness.</p>\n\n<p>Albert Robinson may not be a household name to everyone, but his impact within the boxing community is undeniable. His combination of skill, height, and determination allowed him to make a name for himself in the featherweight division. Whether it was his orthodox stance, exceptional hand speed, or ability to strategize, Robinson's contributions to the sport will forever be remembered and celebrated.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1921-12-09","proDivision":"","proWins":4,"proWinsByKnockout":3,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":0,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":5,"proTotalRounds":22,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":22,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:24.929537","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:24.929546"},{"id":"18163.0","boxrecId":"686269","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/686269","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"joe-mcgann","name":"Joe McGann","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/build/images/main/v6-avatar.svg","residence":"Indiana, USA","birthPlace":null,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"USA","height":null,"reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>Joe McGann: The Welterweight Warrior</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the world of professional boxing, there are few fighters who can match the skill, determination, and resilience of Joe McGann.

Despite not achieving widespread fame or leaving a lasting legacy in the ring, Gonzales's story is one of perseverance, dedication, and the unyielding spirit of a true warrior.</p>\n\n<p>Born on July 12, 1975, in Mexico City, Guillermo Gonzales displayed an early affinity for combat sports. As a youngster, he dabbled in various disciplines, including martial arts and wrestling, before finding his true calling in the noble art of boxing. Fueled by an undefeated amateur career and an insatiable appetite for success, Gonzales turned professional in 1994, determined to make a name for himself in the brutal world of pugilism.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at 5'10\" with a solid build, Gonzales possessed the physical attributes necessary for a successful career in the ring. His exceptional hand speed, coupled with an iron chin and a relentless work rate, made him a formidable opponent for any opponent who dared to share the squared circle with him. Gonzales had an uncanny ability to land precise combinations with lightning speed, leaving his adversaries stunned and bewildered.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Guillermo Gonzales faced several notable opponents, showcasing his boxing skills and warrior spirit. One of his most memorable battles came against the hard-hitting Carlos Rodriguez in 1998.

It was a testament to Gonzales's never-say-die attitude and his ability to turn the tide of a fight with a single punch.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his incredible talent and determination, Gonzales never quite broke into the upper echelons of the sport. His journey was one filled with near misses and untimely setbacks. However, it is precisely these obstacles that make his story all the more compelling. For every triumph he achieved, there seemed to be another stumbling block just around the corner.</p>\n\n<p>One such setback came in the form of a controversial split decision loss to Juan Ramirez in 2001. Many felt that Gonzales had done enough to secure victory, but the judges saw it otherwise. It was a bitter pill to swallow for the Mexican warrior, but true to his nature, he dusted himself off and returned to the gym, eager to prove his worth once again.</p>\n\n<p>Gonzales's never-say-die spirit and constant desire for improvement was epitomized in his rematch with Juan Ramirez a year later.

It was a moment of redemption for Gonzales, a chance to silence the doubters and reaffirm his place among the elite.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Gonzales was known for his humility and respect for the sport. In an era often dominated by trash talk and flashy antics, he stood out as a true gentleman of the ring.
