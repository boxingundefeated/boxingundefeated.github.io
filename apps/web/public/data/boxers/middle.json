Known by his intimidating moniker \"The Animal,\" Fletcher has made a name for himself in the sport with his relentless style and aggressive approach. Born on May 7, 1954, Fletcher has been a force to be reckoned with in the middleweight division, standing at a height of 170cm and boasting a reach of 173cm.</p>\n\n<p>What sets Fletcher apart from his adversaries is his southpaw stance. As a left-hander, he has the advantage of throwing punches from an angle that many fighters are not accustomed to. This often catches his opponents off guard, leaving them vulnerable to his powerful blows. Fletcher's southpaw stance combined with his lightning-fast footwork makes for a lethal combination in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of weight class, Fletcher competes in the middleweight division. This is a highly competitive weight class that requires fighters to maintain a weight range between 154 and 160 pounds.

But what makes him stand out is his ability to overcome these hurdles and bounce back stronger than ever.</p>\n\n<p>When discussing Fletcher's boxing style, it's impossible to ignore his burstiness. Burstiness refers to an athlete's ability to deliver powerful, explosive punches in quick succession. This is a trademark of Fletcher's fighting style, as he often overwhelms his opponents with a flurry of punches.

One such fighter who has displayed incredible skill and finesse as a southpaw is none other than Dave Foley.</p>\n\n<p>Although not known for any particular nickname, Foley has made a name for himself through his impressive fighting style and sheer determination. As a southpaw, he poses a significant challenge to his opponents, as the majority of fighters are accustomed to facing more orthodox fighters who primarily use their right hand as their power hand.</p>\n\n<p>The southpaw stance, also known as the \"left-handed\" or \"lefty\" stance, is a preferred stance for many fighters who possess excellent footwork and lateral movement. Foley is no exception, as he has honed his skills to use this stance to his advantage.</p>\n\n<p>In the southpaw stance, Foley stands with his right foot slightly in front of his left foot, angling his body to the right. This positioning allows him to effectively utilize his left hand as his primary weapon, often catching his opponents off guard with his quick and powerful jabs and hooks.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons the southpaw stance can be perplexing for opponents is that it disrupts the typical pattern of punches they may be accustomed to defending against. Most fighters are used to the more common orthodox stance, where the left hand serves as the jab and the right hand as the power punch.</p>\n\n<p>However, when facing a southpaw like Foley, fighters must adjust their defense strategies and be ready to deal with the left-handed attacks coming from a different angle. This presents a challenge that can leave opponents feeling perplexed and struggling to find their footing.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of Foley's fighting style that keeps opponents on their toes is his burstiness. Burstiness refers to an explosive and sudden increase in activity or force. Foley has demonstrated time and time again that he possesses incredible burstiness, catching his opponents off guard with his quick and powerful punches.</p> \n\n<p>His swift footwork and ability to close the distance between himself and his opponent in the blink of an eye allow him to deliver devastating blows and create opportunities for effective combinations.</p>\n\n<p>Opponents may find themselves in a constant state of surprise as Foley launches unexpected attacks, leaving them little time to react or defend effectively. This burstiness adds an element of unpredictability to his fighting style, making him a boxer that opponents have to be constantly wary of.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to his southpaw stance and burstiness, Foley's overall boxing skills and experience make him a formidable opponent in the ring. With over 20 years of professional boxing experience, he has honed his craft and constantly evolves as a fighter.</p>\n\n<p>His training, discipline, and dedication have allowed him to master various techniques and strategies, giving him a well-rounded approach to the sport. Whether it's his precision punches, evasive footwork, or strategic counterattacks, Foley brings both skill and intelligence to his fights.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that while the southpaw stance and burstiness can be advantageous, they also come with their own set of challenges. Foley, like any other fighter, has had to adapt his style to overcome these challenges and continuously improve as a boxer.</p>\n\n<p>Though not known for any specific nickname, Foley has earned the respect and admiration of fellow fighters and fans for his impressive skills and resilience inside the ring. His southpaw stance and burstiness make him a true force to be reckoned with, as opponents find themselves perplexed by his unorthodox approach and caught off guard by his explosive attacks.</p>\n\n<p>As Foley continues to lace up his gloves and step into the ring, fans can expect to witness thrilling displays of boxing prowess from this southpaw sensation. With his unique style and unwavering determination, Dave Foley is undoubtedly a boxer deserving of recognition and admiration in the world of professional boxing.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"2004-11-06","proDivision":"middle","proWins":2,"proWinsByKnockout":1,"proLosses":5,"proLossesByKnockout":2,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":7,"proTotalRounds":23,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":23,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:05.858116","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:05.858119"},{"id":"16267.0","boxrecId":"280176","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/280176","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"howard-hamlin","name":"Howard Hamlin","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/build/images/main/v6-avatar.svg","residence":"Augusta, Georgia, USA","birthPlace":null,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"USA","height":null,"reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>Howard Hamlin: Rising Star in the Boxing World</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to rising talent in the boxing world, one name that has been making waves is Howard Hamlin.

One such boxer who deserves recognition for his contributions to the sport is Dale Williams. While he may not be a household name like Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson, Williams' journey in boxing is one that is worthy of admiration.</p>\n\n<p>Known for his relentless style and ferocious power, Williams was a force to be reckoned with inside the boxing ring. Standing at 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighing around 160 pounds, he possessed a formidable presence that often intimidated his opponents. His aggression and knockout power were his trademarks, and they made him a fan favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Born on August 2, 1972, in South Dakota, Williams grew up with a passion for boxing. He started honing his skills at a young age, dedicating countless hours to training and refining his technique. His hard work paid off when he made his professional debut on May 4, 1996, against Rodney Moore. Williams showcased his potential by winning the fight via third-round technical knockout.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of his career, Williams faced a number of notable opponents, including former world champions and top contenders. His style of fighting made him a difficult matchup for anyone in his weight class. He had a knack for ending fights early with his devastating punching power, and he often left his opponents sprawled on the canvas.</p>\n\n<p>One of Williams' most memorable bouts came on December 3, 2004, when he faced off against Kofi Jantuah for the vacant WBO NABO middleweight title. It was a grueling back-and-forth battle that showcased both fighters' determination and resolve. In the end, Williams emerged victorious, winning the bout via unanimous decision.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Williams' career was marred by injuries that hindered his progression in the sport. He suffered a major setback in 2008 when he ruptured his Achilles tendon during a fight against Sergio Gomez. The injury required surgery and forced Williams to take a break from boxing to recover.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the setback, Williams didn't let the injury dampen his spirits. He continued to train and remained determined to make a comeback. After a lengthy period of rehabilitation, he returned to the ring on November 20, 2010, to face John Jackson. It was a triumphant return for Williams, as he defeated Jackson via second-round knockout.</p>\n\n<p>Williams' comeback was short-lived, as he retired from professional boxing in 2011 with a record of 34 wins (31 by knockout) and 10 losses. Although his career was not as illustrious as some of boxing's all-time greats, Williams left a lasting impact on the sport with his aggressive style and knockout power.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the ring, Williams has been involved in various philanthropic endeavors aimed at giving back to his community. He has used his platform as a boxer to raise awareness for important causes, such as youth empowerment and anti-bullying campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Dale Williams remains a respected figure in the boxing world. While his name may not be as widely recognized as some of the sport's legends, his contributions to the sport and his inspiring journey are worth celebrating. Williams serves as a reminder that greatness can be found in the most unexpected places, and that true champions are not always defined by their accolades, but by their perseverance and character.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1953-09-05","proDivision":"middle","proWins":0,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":1,"proTotalRounds":2,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":2,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:33:14.438178","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:33:14.438180"}]
