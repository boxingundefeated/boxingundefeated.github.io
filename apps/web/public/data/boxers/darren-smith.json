He carefully studies his opponents, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and devises a game plan to exploit any vulnerabilities. This adaptability allows him to bring his A-game to every fight, regardless of who is standing in the opposite corner.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the ring, Daz is known for his dedication to training and maintaining his physical fitness. Boxing requires immense discipline and sacrifice, and Daz embodies these qualities wholeheartedly. He puts in countless hours in the gym, honing his skills and pushing his body to the limit. This level of commitment and hard work is what sets him apart from other fighters in his weight class.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Daz has faced and triumphed over some of the toughest fighters in the welterweight division. His determination and never-say-die attitude have earned him the respect of his peers and fans alike. But Daz isn't content with just his previous successes. He continues to push himself, constantly striving to improve and reach new heights.</p>\n\n<p>As fans, we are privileged to witness the incredible journey of Darren \"Daz\" Smith. Whether he's delivering devastating knockouts or going the distance in grueling battles, Daz never fails to entertain. His boxing prowess and indomitable spirit make him a force to be reckoned with in the welterweight division, and we can't wait to see what he accomplishes next.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"2022-03-18","proDivision":"welter","proWins":2,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":0,"proLossesByKnockout":0,"proDraws":2,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":4,"proTotalRounds":16,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":16,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:18.291132","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:18.291139","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\": \"1075845\", \"boxrecId\": \"2989494\", \"boutDate\": \"Jul 23\", \"opponentName\": \"Paul Scaife\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Lightwaves Leisure Centre, Wakefield\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"draw\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/871844/2989494\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"1075845\", \"boxrecId\": \"2949889\", \"boutDate\": \"Apr 23\", \"opponentName\": \"Jake Osgood\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Lightwaves Leisure Centre, Wakefield\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/867093/2949889\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"1075845\", \"boxrecId\": \"2907682\", \"boutDate\": \"Nov 22\", \"opponentName\": \"Alexander Zeledon\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"LUFC Banqueting Suite, Elland Road, Leeds\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"draw\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/864454/2907682\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"1075845\", \"boxrecId\": \"2812245\", \"boutDate\": \"Mar 22\", \"opponentName\": \"Vladimir \\nFleischhauer\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"LUFC Banqueting Suite, Elland Road, Leeds\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/850914/2812245\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}]"}
