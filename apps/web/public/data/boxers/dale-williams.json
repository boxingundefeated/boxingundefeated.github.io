One such boxer who deserves recognition for his contributions to the sport is Dale Williams. While he may not be a household name like Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson, Williams' journey in boxing is one that is worthy of admiration.</p>\n\n<p>Known for his relentless style and ferocious power, Williams was a force to be reckoned with inside the boxing ring. Standing at 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighing around 160 pounds, he possessed a formidable presence that often intimidated his opponents. His aggression and knockout power were his trademarks, and they made him a fan favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Born on August 2, 1972, in South Dakota, Williams grew up with a passion for boxing. He started honing his skills at a young age, dedicating countless hours to training and refining his technique. His hard work paid off when he made his professional debut on May 4, 1996, against Rodney Moore. Williams showcased his potential by winning the fight via third-round technical knockout.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of his career, Williams faced a number of notable opponents, including former world champions and top contenders. His style of fighting made him a difficult matchup for anyone in his weight class. He had a knack for ending fights early with his devastating punching power, and he often left his opponents sprawled on the canvas.</p>\n\n<p>One of Williams' most memorable bouts came on December 3, 2004, when he faced off against Kofi Jantuah for the vacant WBO NABO middleweight title. It was a grueling back-and-forth battle that showcased both fighters' determination and resolve. In the end, Williams emerged victorious, winning the bout via unanimous decision.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Williams' career was marred by injuries that hindered his progression in the sport. He suffered a major setback in 2008 when he ruptured his Achilles tendon during a fight against Sergio Gomez. The injury required surgery and forced Williams to take a break from boxing to recover.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the setback, Williams didn't let the injury dampen his spirits. He continued to train and remained determined to make a comeback. After a lengthy period of rehabilitation, he returned to the ring on November 20, 2010, to face John Jackson. It was a triumphant return for Williams, as he defeated Jackson via second-round knockout.</p>\n\n<p>Williams' comeback was short-lived, as he retired from professional boxing in 2011 with a record of 34 wins (31 by knockout) and 10 losses. Although his career was not as illustrious as some of boxing's all-time greats, Williams left a lasting impact on the sport with his aggressive style and knockout power.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the ring, Williams has been involved in various philanthropic endeavors aimed at giving back to his community. He has used his platform as a boxer to raise awareness for important causes, such as youth empowerment and anti-bullying campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Dale Williams remains a respected figure in the boxing world. While his name may not be as widely recognized as some of the sport's legends, his contributions to the sport and his inspiring journey are worth celebrating. Williams serves as a reminder that greatness can be found in the most unexpected places, and that true champions are not always defined by their accolades, but by their perseverance and character.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1953-09-05","proDivision":"middle","proWins":0,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":1,"proTotalRounds":2,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":2,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:33:14.438178","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:33:14.438180","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\": \"99438\", \"boxrecId\": \"532669\", \"boutDate\": \"Sep 53\", \"opponentName\": \"Neal Rivers\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Hurricane\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"loss\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/297173/532669\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}]"}
