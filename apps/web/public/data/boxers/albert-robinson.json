One such fighter who left a lasting impact on the sport is Albert Robinson. Born on June 18, 1947, Robinson made a name for himself in the featherweight division, standing at a height of 180cm with an orthodox stance.</p>\n\n<p>Although there may not be any recorded nicknames associated with Robinson, his accomplishments in the ring speak for themselves. As a featherweight boxer, Robinson competed in a weight class known for its speed and agility. This weight class typically includes fighters weighing between 57 kilograms (126 pounds) and 59 kilograms (130 pounds).</p>\n\n<p>Robinson's career spanned over several years, showcasing his skill and determination inside the squared circle. Throughout his boxing journey, he faced off against some of the most formidable opponents of his time, proving himself to be a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key factors that set Robinson apart was his orthodox stance. In boxing, fighters can either adopt an orthodox or a southpaw stance. An orthodox stance means that the boxer's left hand is their lead hand, while their right hand is their power hand. This stance allows for powerful right-hand punches and quick left jabs, which can catch opponents off guard.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at a height of 180cm, Robinson had the advantage of being able to deliver his punches from a higher vantage point, giving him greater reach and leverage. This height also allowed him to maintain a comfortable distance from his opponents, making it difficult for them to close the distance and land effective punches.</p>\n\n<p>The featherweight division is known for its speed and agility, with fighters often relying on quick footwork and swift combinations to outmaneuver their opponents. Throughout his career, Robinson showcased his agility by constantly moving in and out of range, making it challenging for his opponents to land clean shots.</p>\n\n<p>As a featherweight boxer, Robinson faced opponents who were not only physically skilled but also highly strategic in their approach. Each fight presented a unique challenge, requiring Robinson to adapt and come up with effective game plans to secure victory.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the ring, Robinson's skills were undeniable. He displayed exceptional hand speed, allowing him to unleash a flurry of punches in rapid succession. His precision and accuracy were also top-notch, as he often landed clean shots on his opponents' vulnerable areas.</p>\n\n<p>Robinson's ability to gauge distance and timing was another aspect that made him a formidable opponent. He had a keen sense of when to strike, effectively using his reach advantage to keep his opponents at bay or close in for a devastating blow.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Robinson faced both victories and defeats, as any boxer would. However, it is important to remember that boxing is not solely defined by wins and losses. It is the spirit of the sport, the determination to succeed, and the willingness to push oneself to the limit that truly matter.</p>\n\n<p>Even though there may not be any recorded nicknames associated with Albert Robinson, his legacy as a featherweight boxer endures. His career serves as a reminder of the dedication and commitment required to compete in the brutal yet thrilling world of boxing. Robinson's story inspires future generations of fighters to step into the ring, face their challenges head-on, and strive for greatness.</p>\n\n<p>Albert Robinson may not be a household name to everyone, but his impact within the boxing community is undeniable. His combination of skill, height, and determination allowed him to make a name for himself in the featherweight division. Whether it was his orthodox stance, exceptional hand speed, or ability to strategize, Robinson's contributions to the sport will forever be remembered and celebrated.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1921-12-09","proDivision":"","proWins":4,"proWinsByKnockout":3,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":0,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":5,"proTotalRounds":22,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":22,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:24.929537","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:24.929546","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\": \"683429\", \"boxrecId\": \"1880546\", \"boutDate\": \"Mar 23\", \"opponentName\": \"Tommy Bury\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Carr Road Skating Rink, Nelson\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/690172/1880546\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"683429\", \"boxrecId\": \"1880540\", \"boutDate\": \"Jan 23\", \"opponentName\": \"J Steele\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Carr Road Skating Rink, Nelson\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/690138/1880540\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"683429\", \"boxrecId\": \"1880331\", \"boutDate\": \"Oct 22\", \"opponentName\": \"Joe Woodruff\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Carr Road Skating Rink, Nelson\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"loss\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/690110/1880331\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"683429\", \"boxrecId\": \"1880362\", \"boutDate\": \"Feb 22\", \"opponentName\": \"Bob Alston\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Carr Road Skating Rink, Nelson\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/690116/1880362\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"683429\", \"boxrecId\": \"1852223\", \"boutDate\": \"Dec 21\", \"opponentName\": \"Lois Lawson\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Carr Road Skating Rink, Nelson\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"win\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/683527/1852223\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}]"}
