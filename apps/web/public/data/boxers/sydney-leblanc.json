LeBlanc understands the importance of using his platform to make a positive impact and proves that he is not only a fighter in the ring but also a fighter for a better world.</p>\n\n<p>As LeBlanc continues to dominate the super middleweight division, boxing fans around the world eagerly await his next move. Will he face off against another top contender? Will he move up in weight class to take on even bigger challenges? Only time will tell.</p>\n\n<p>But one thing is for certain, Sydney LeBlanc has already left an indelible mark on the sport of boxing.
