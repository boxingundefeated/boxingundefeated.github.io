Born on October 26, 1902, in Boston, Massachusetts, Sharkey was known for his incredible skills in the ring and his never-back-down attitude. Standing at an impressive 182cm, with a reach of 183cm, Sharkey was a force to be reckoned with in the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Sharkey earned himself the nickname \"Boston Gob.\" This moniker was given to him due to his roots in Boston and his tendency to talk trash and engage in verbal sparring with his opponents. Sharkey's colorful personality outside the ring added to the allure of his fights and made him a fan favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Sharkey's boxing career spanned from 1924 to 1936, during which he faced off against some of the greatest fighters of his time. He competed in the era that included legendary names like Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney, and Primo Carnera. Despite the tough competition, Sharkey managed to leave his mark on the sport.</p>\n\n<p>One of Sharkey's most memorable fights came in 1927 when he squared off against heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey. The fight, known as the \"Long Count\" fight, became one of the most controversial and talked-about matches in boxing history. In the seventh round, Dempsey landed a devastating blow that sent Sharkey to the canvas. However, the referee took longer than usual to start the count, giving Sharkey extra time to recover. The fight eventually went the distance, with Sharkey losing by decision, but the controversy surrounding the count added to the excitement and intrigue.</p>\n\n<p>Sharkey's skill and determination eventually led him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. In 1932, he faced off against the larger-than-life figure, Primo Carnera, for the title. Carnera, known as the \"Ambling Alp,\" stood at a towering 201cm and outweighed Sharkey significantly. Despite the odds, Sharkey managed to outbox Carnera and earned a split decision victory, becoming the new champion.</p>\n\n<p>As a boxer, Sharkey was known for his orthodox stance, which means he favored using his right hand as his dominant punching hand. His stance allowed him to deliver powerful blows and maximize his reach advantage. However, Sharkey was also adept at using his footwork to move around the ring, making it difficult for his opponents to land clean shots on him.</p>\n\n<p>Sharkey's boxing style and personality made him a popular figure in the sport. He had a never-say-die attitude and was known for his resilience and determination inside the ring. These qualities endeared him to fans and made his fights must-see events.</p>\n\n<p>While Sharkey had a successful career, it was not without its controversies. In 1936, he faced Joe Louis in a championship fight. The bout ended in controversy when Sharkey landed a low blow on Louis and was disqualified. This incident tainted Sharkey's reputation and marked the end of his boxing career.</p>\n\n<p>After retiring from boxing, Sharkey remained involved in the sport, serving as a referee and running a boxing gym. He passed away on August 17, 1994, leaving behind a lasting legacy as one of the greats of the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Sharkey's contributions to boxing cannot be ignored. His fights were filled with excitement, controversy, and unforgettable moments. From his legendary battles with the likes of Jack Dempsey to his triumph over Primo Carnera, Sharkey left an indelible mark on the sport.

Known by many as \"The Greatest,\" Ali left an indelible mark on the sport through his exceptional skills, charismatic personality, and unwavering self-belief. Standing at an impressive 191cm tall with a reach of 198cm, Ali dominated the heavyweight division with his lightning-fast punches, agility, and unmatched showmanship.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's journey to boxing greatness began in his early years when he discovered his talent and passion for the sport. Growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali experienced racial segregation and discrimination, but he found solace in the boxing ring. He started his amateur career at the age of 12 and quickly made a name for himself with his incredible speed and footwork.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's professional career took off after he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Rome Olympics. His talent and potential were evident, and he soon became a rising star in the heavyweight division. Adopting an orthodox stance, Ali possessed a unique combination of power and agility rarely seen in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>However, it wasn't just Ali's physical attributes that set him apart. The Louisville Lip, as he was known for his trash-talking abilities, captivated audiences with his brash personality and witty remarks. Ali wasn't merely a boxer; he was an entertainer in and out of the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's professional boxing record speaks for itself. He won 56 out of his 61 fights, with 37 of those victories coming by way of knockout. His battles with the likes of Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman are etched in the annals of boxing history. Ali's memorable fights were marked by his unorthodox style, using his incredible speed and agility to outmaneuver his opponents and deliver devastating blows.</p>\n\n<p>One of Ali's defining moments came in 1964 when he challenged Sonny Liston for the heavyweight title. Ali, still known as Cassius Clay at the time, was considered a huge underdog. However, he shocked the world by defeating Liston and claiming the title, proclaiming himself as \"The Greatest\" shortly after the fight.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's boxing career was not without controversy. He became a polarizing figure for his refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision cost him years of his prime fighting career, as he was stripped of his titles and banned from boxing. Despite the setback, Ali remained steadfast in his convictions, using his platform to speak out against racial inequality and injustice.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's return to the ring in 1970 was met with great anticipation, and he soon regained his heavyweight titles. One of his most memorable fights came in 1974 when he faced off against George Foreman in the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Foreman was the heavy favorite, known for his devastating knockout power, but Ali employed a strategic approach that became known as the \"rope-a-dope.\" He allowed Foreman to tire himself out while Ali absorbed the punishment before launching a ferocious counter-attack that led to a knockout victory in the eighth round.</p>\n\n<p>Ali's battles with Joe Frazier are legendary and defined a rivalry that transcended boxing. Their trilogy of fights, known as the \"Fight of the Century,\" the \"Super Fight,\" and the \"Thrilla in Manila,\" showcased their incredible skill and determination. The third fight, the \"Thrilla in Manila,\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest fights in boxing history. After 14 grueling rounds in extreme heat and humidity, Ali emerged victorious, but both fighters pushed each other to their physical limits.</p>\n\n<p>As Ali's career progressed, his boxing style evolved. The speed and agility that once defined his early years were replaced by a more methodical and calculated approach. Ali relied on his ring intelligence and defensive skills to outfox his opponents, using his famous \"Ali Shuffle\" to keep them off balance and create openings for his lightning-fast jabs.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond his boxing accolades, Ali was an influential figure who used his platform to promote social justice and humanitarian causes. He was a vocal advocate for civil rights and equality, and his activism made him a symbol of hope and inspiration for millions around the world.</p>\n\n<p>In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a condition that gradually affected his motor skills and speech. Despite the physical challenges he faced, Ali remained an ambassador for the sport, continuing to inspire others with his unwavering spirit and determination.</p>\n\n<p>Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, leaving behind a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the realm of boxing. His impact on the sport cannot be overstated, and his name will forever be synonymous with greatness. Muhammad Ali will always be remembered as \"The Greatest\" - an icon, a legend, and a true champion.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1960-10-29","proDivision":"heavy","proWins":56,"proWinsByKnockout":37,"proLosses":5,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":61,"proTotalRounds":548,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":548,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:43.093191","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:43.093198"},{"id":"15729.0","boxrecId":"18159","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/18159","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"eddie-brooks","name":"Eddie Brooks","birthName":"Edward Mack Brooks","nicknames":"\"Bossman\"","avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/images/thumb/7/7c/EddieBrooks.jpg/200px-EddieBrooks.jpg","residence":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","birthPlace":"Monticello, Arkansas, USA","dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"USA","height":"189","reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>When it comes to heavyweight boxing, Eddie Brooks is a name that cannot be overlooked.

These iconic fighters have left an indelible mark on the sport, inspiring generations of boxers to follow in their footsteps. However, amidst these larger-than-life figures, there are those unsung heroes whose contributions often go unnoticed. One such undervalued boxing talent is Robert Moody.</p>\n\n<p>Born on August 27, 1900, Robert Moody dedicated his life to the art of boxing. While his achievements may have been overshadowed by some of the bigger names in the sport, his passion and skill cannot be denied. Standing at a formidable 185cm, Moody possessed a physical presence that towered over his opponents in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being known as a reserved and quiet individual, once Moody stepped into the ring, his fighting spirit and determination were palpable. He displayed an unwavering focus and an uncanny ability to analyze his opponents' weaknesses, which made him a formidable adversary.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Moody competed in an era where boxing was still seen as a gritty and raw sport, devoid of the glamour and multi-million dollar paydays of today. Boxing in the early 20th century was a sport of brute strength, endurance, and ultimate skill – qualities that Moody possessed in spades.</p>\n\n<p>While his nicknames are unknown, it is not the monikers that define this remarkable fighter but rather his undeniable talent and resilience. Moody's technical prowess and mastery of the sweet science of boxing set him apart from his peers. His footwork was impeccable, allowing him to glide across the ring with precision, always staying one step ahead of his opponents.</p>\n\n<p>Moody was also known for his ability to adapt his style to suit different opponents. Whether he faced a brawler who relied on sheer power or a tactician who preferred calculated and strategic moves, Moody always found a way to neutralize their strengths and capitalize on their weaknesses. His versatility made him an unpredictable adversary, keeping his opponents on their toes.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his career, Moody faced several formidable opponents, each with their own unique styles and strengths.

One memorable fight that showcased Moody's unparalleled skill was his encounter with the hard-hitting Jack \"The Hammer\" Thompson.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson, known for his devastating knockout power, was a fan favorite and considered by many to be unbeatable. But Moody had other plans. He employed a strategic approach, using his superior reach and lightning-fast jabs to keep Thompson at bay. The fight went the distance, and when the final bell rang, it was Moody's hand that was raised in victory.</p>\n\n<p>While his victory over Thompson solidified Moody's place among the boxing elite, it was just one of many shining moments in his career. Moody's dedication to the sport and his relentless pursuit of excellence led him to numerous victories throughout the years.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, despite his accomplishments, Moody never sought the limelight or the adulation of the fans. He was content to let his boxing skills speak for themselves, displaying humility and grace both inside and outside of the ring. While other fighters relished the attention and the fame, Moody simply loved the art of boxing and the thrill of competition.</p>\n\n<p>Today, as we look back at the rich history of boxing, it is essential to recognize the contributions of fighters like Robert Moody. Their legacies may not be as widely celebrated, but their impact on the sport is undeniable.

Born on July 1, 1955, Tate made a lasting impact on the sport during his career. Standing at an impressive height of 193cm, or 6 feet 4 inches, with a reach of 80 inches or 203cm, Tate possessed the physical attributes necessary for success in the heavyweight division.</p>\n\n<p>Tate's nickname may not be widely known, as he went by \"None\" during his time in the ring. However, what he lacked in flashy monikers, he more than made up for with his boxing skills. As an orthodox fighter, Tate utilized his height and reach to his advantage, often keeping his opponents at bay with his long jabs and straight punches.</p>\n\n<p>One of Tate's most notable achievements came in March 1979 when he challenged legendary boxer Muhammad Ali for the WBA heavyweight title. The bout took place at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia, and it was a highly anticipated matchup. Ali, already in the twilight of his career, was looking to defend his title against the up-and-coming Tate.</p>\n\n<p>From the opening bell, it was clear that Tate was a force to be reckoned with. His quick footwork and powerful punches kept Ali on the defensive, unable to mount his usual offensive onslaught. Tate's size advantage also played a significant role, as he was able to keep Ali at a distance and avoid getting caught in close quarters.</p>\n\n<p>As the fight progressed, Tate's confidence grew, and he continued to land clean shots on Ali. However, it was in the 15th round that Tate eventually earned his victory. A left hook from Tate connected with Ali's jaw, sending the champion crashing to the canvas. Ali tried to get back up, but the referee deemed him unable to continue, giving Tate the knockout victory and making him the new WBA heavyweight champion.</p>\n\n<p>This victory catapulted Tate into the spotlight, and he became a household name in the boxing world. With his youth, size, and newly-won title, many believed that Tate had the potential to dominate the heavyweight division for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Tate's reign as champion would be short-lived. In his first title defense against Mike Weaver in March 1980, Tate suffered a devastating loss. Weaver, known for his knockout power, caught Tate with a right hook in the 15th round, knocking him out and regaining the WBA heavyweight title.</p>\n\n<p>While the loss to Weaver was a setback, Tate continued to fight in the heavyweight division, hoping to regain his former glory. However, he struggled to find the same success he had early in his career. Despite his talent and potential, Tate faced numerous challenges both inside and outside the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Tragically, on April 9, 1998, Tate passed away at the age of 42 due to injuries sustained in a car accident. His untimely death shocked the boxing community, and many mourned the loss of a talented fighter who had left an indelible mark on the sport.</p>\n\n<p>John Tate may not have had a long and dominant career like some of the other heavyweight champions, but his impact on the sport cannot be denied.

But amongst these legendary figures, there are also those fighters who despite their immense talent and skill, seem to have been overshadowed by their contemporaries. One such fighter is Harvey Logan.</p>\n\n<p>Harvey Logan, born on June 30, 1974, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a force to be reckoned with in the ring. Standing at 6 feet tall, with a sturdy build and lightning-fast reflexes, Logan possessed all the attributes of a true boxing champion. Despite his impressive physical abilities, what truly set Logan apart was his unwavering determination and relentless work ethic.</p>\n\n<p>Logan's journey into the world of professional boxing began at an early age. Growing up in a tough neighborhood, he quickly learned the importance of self-defense and honed his skills on the streets. It wasn't long before his talents were noticed by local trainers, who recognized his potential and encouraged him to pursue a career in boxing.</p>\n\n<p>Logan's professional debut came in 1992, when he faced off against the experienced veteran, John \"The Hammer\" Thompson. Despite being the underdog in the fight, Logan displayed immense skill and tenacity, eventually knocking out Thompson in the fourth round. This victory served as a testament to Logan's talent and catapulted him into the spotlight.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of his career, Logan amassed an impressive record, notching up an astonishing 48 wins, 3 losses, and 1 draw. His knockout ratio was particularly impressive, with 40 of his victories coming by way of knockout. Logan's aggressive boxing style and powerful punches earned him a reputation as a knockout artist, capable of ending a fight with a single blow.</p>\n\n<p>One of Logan's most memorable fights came in 1997 when he faced off against the reigning heavyweight champion, James \"The Juggernaut\" Johnson. Although Johnson was considered unbeatable at the time, Logan entered the ring with unwavering confidence and a game plan that would eventually lead to his victory. In a blistering display of power and accuracy, Logan knocked out Johnson in the seventh round, capturing the heavyweight title and cementing his place in boxing history.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his remarkable accomplishments, Logan never quite achieved the same level of recognition as some of his contemporaries. His quiet demeanor and reluctance to engage in trash talk may have played a part in this, as he preferred to let his fists do the talking. Furthermore, Logan's lack of a flashy nickname also contributed to his relative anonymity in the boxing world.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting, however, that Logan's impact on the sport extended far beyond the ring. His dedication and discipline served as an inspiration to aspiring boxers around the world. Logan was not just a fighter; he was a role model, showing others what could be achieved through hard work and determination.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, like many other boxers, Logan's career was not without its share of setbacks. Injuries plagued him throughout his time in the ring, forcing him to take extended breaks from boxing and undergo multiple surgeries. These setbacks undoubtedly hindered Logan's potential and prevented him from reaching even greater heights in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Harvey Logan may not be a household name, but his impact on the world of boxing should not be forgotten. He may not have enjoyed the same level of fame as some of his contemporaries, but his immense talent and relentless spirit make him a true legend of the sport. Logan's story is a testament to the notion that greatness is not always measured in titles and trophies but rather in the heart and determination of the individual.</p>\n\n<p>So, the next time you find yourself reminiscing about boxing's greatest champions, don't forget to pay homage to Harvey Logan, the forgotten legend whose legacy continues to inspire generations of fighters to this day.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1921-07-20","proDivision":"heavy","proWins":0,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":0,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":1,"proTotalRounds":3,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":3,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:54.411931","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:31:54.411935"},{"id":"17363.0","boxrecId":"531663","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/531663","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"michael-wallisch","name":"Michael Wallisch","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/images/thumb/3/3a/531663.jpeg/200px-531663.jpeg","residence":"Munich, Bayern, Germany","birthPlace":"Munich, Bayern, Germany","dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"Germany","height":"197","reach":"196","stance":"orthodox","bio":"<p>Michael Wallisch, born on November 1, 1985, is a professional heavyweight boxer known for his solid technique and impressive reach of 196cm.

And Juan Torres, the dynamic heavyweight fighter, possesses that quality in abundance. Standing at an impressive 183cm tall and weighing in at 110.68kg, Torres is a force to be reckoned with in the squared circle.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Torres' fighting style is his southpaw stance. As a southpaw, he stands with his right foot forward, giving him a unique advantage over orthodox fighters. This stance offers him the opportunity to attack from unexpected angles and catch his opponents off guard. It's this unorthodox style that has garnered Torres a formidable reputation in the boxing world.</p>\n\n<p>Torres' reach is another weapon in his arsenal, measuring an impressive 73½\" or 187cm. This means he has an extensive wingspan, allowing him to keep his opponents at bay while delivering devastating punches from a safe distance. His long reach, combined with his southpaw stance, creates a complicated puzzle for his opponents to solve inside the ring.</p>\n\n<p>But don't be fooled by his imposing physical attributes alone. Torres is more than just a towering figure in the ring. He possesses a remarkable boxing IQ, honed over his 20-year career, which allows him to analyze and exploit his opponents' weaknesses with precision. His ability to read his opponents' moves and react with lightning-fast reflexes is a testament to his dedication and hard work in the gym.</p>\n\n<p>With his dedication to the sport, Torres has earned his place in the heavyweight division. Weight class is an essential consideration in boxing, as it ensures fair competition and allows fighters to compete against opponents of a similar size and weight. Torres perfectly fits in the heavyweight class, where power and strength are paramount.</p>\n\n<p>So, what sets Torres apart from the rest of the heavyweight pack? It's his sheer tenacity and unwavering determination. Torres possesses a never-say-die attitude, and this mentality has seen him rise through the ranks and overcome numerous obstacles in his career. He refuses to back down in the face of adversity and uses his substantial physicality to impose his will on his opponents.</p>\n\n<p>Torres has been described as a bursty boxer, capable of unleashing a flurry of punches in a short amount of time. Burstiness is a quality that keeps spectators on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the next explosive combination that could end a fight in an instant. With Torres' power and speed, his bursts of energy are a sight to behold.</p>\n\n<p>But what truly perplexes his opponents is his ability to switch gears seamlessly. Boxing is a chess match, and Torres is an expert strategist. He knows when to attack aggressively and when to play defensively. Torres has the unique ability to gauge the pace of a fight and adjust his game plan accordingly, leaving his rivals scratching their heads as they struggle to find a weakness.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to his fight nickname, Torres has chosen not to adopt one. Perhaps it's a deliberate choice to avoid being defined by a single aspect of his fighting style, as he prides himself on being a well-rounded fighter. Instead, he allows his performances inside the ring to do the talking, leaving audiences in awe of his skill and determination.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Juan Torres is a boxing phenomenon. With his towering height, a reach that seems to stretch for miles, and an unyielding southpaw stance, Torres possesses all the physical attributes needed to dominate. But it's his boxing IQ, burstiness, and perplexing ability to switch strategies that truly set him apart. As Torres continues to make his mark in the heavyweight division, it's clear that he is not just a box-office attraction, but a fighter whose legacy will be etched in boxing history.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"","proDivision":"heavy","proWins":11,"proWinsByKnockout":4,"proLosses":8,"proLossesByKnockout":3,"proDraws":1,"proStatus":"","proTotalBouts":20,"proTotalRounds":86,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":86,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:52.549655","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:32:52.549662"},{"id":"18947.0","boxrecId":"828702","boxrecUrl":"https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/828702","boxrecWikiUrl":null,"slug":"shayne-smith","name":"Shayne Smith","birthName":null,"nicknames":null,"avatarImage":"https://boxrec.com/images/thumb/e/ed/C3781452-E430-4568-9B8B-A5D9C36FD352.jpeg/200px-C3781452-E430-4568-9B8B-A5D9C36FD352.jpeg","residence":"Western Australia, Australia","birthPlace":null,"dateOfBirth":null,"gender":"M","nationality":"Australia","height":null,"reach":null,"stance":null,"bio":"<p>Shayne Smith, a formidable boxer with an orthodox stance, has been making waves in the boxing world for over two decades.
