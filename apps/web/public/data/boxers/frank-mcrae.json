Standing at an impressive 198.1cm, McRae towered over his opponents in the ring, using his height and reach to his advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Although McRae doesn't have any catchy nicknames like some of his boxing counterparts, it's his physical presence that speaks volumes. When McRae steps into the ring, his opponents know they are up against a formidable force.</p>\n\n<p>Boxing is a sport that often rewards size and power, and McRae certainly fits the bill. With his towering height, he has the unique ability to throw punches at different angles, making it difficult for his opponents to defend themselves. He is known for his devastating uppercuts, which can send opponents flying backward.</p>\n\n<p>But being tall in the boxing world also comes with its own set of challenges. While it may be easier to reach opponents from a distance, it also means that McRae has a larger target for his opponents to aim at. His opponents often try to get inside his reach to unleash a flurry of punches, attempting to nullify his advantages.</p>\n\n<p>McRae's height is certainly an advantage, but it's his skill and technique that truly set him apart.

McRae's height can sometimes make it challenging for him to maintain a low center of gravity, which is crucial for balance and stability. Opponents who are more skilled in close-quarters combat can use this to their advantage, making it difficult for McRae to effectively defend himself.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, McRae's determination and perseverance have propelled him to great heights in his career. He has faced some of the toughest opponents in the sport and has come out victorious on many occasions.
