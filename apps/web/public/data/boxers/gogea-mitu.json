He moved with surprising grace for a boxer of his size, slipping and dodging punches with astonishing ease. His agility allowed him to avoid getting hit while setting up devastating counterattacks.</p>\n\n<p>Mitu's fighting style was a unique blend of power, strategy, and agility. His punches possessed the raw force of a charging bull, but he had the nimbleness of a cat, effortlessly evading danger and expertly positioning himself to deliver his own punishing blows.</p>\n\n<p>Picturing Mitu in the ring evokes images of a giant taking on opponents, his powerful fists crashing down like a raging storm.
