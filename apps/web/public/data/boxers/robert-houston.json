With over 20 years of experience in the sport, Houston has established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the ring. Standing at an impressive 185.42cm tall and utilizing an orthodox stance, Houston has utilized his physical attributes, skill, and determination to notch up an impressive record.</p>\n\n<p>Known primarily by his given name, Robert Houston has yet to adopt any well-known nicknames throughout his career. While some fighters may have a catchy moniker that sticks with them throughout their time in the sport, Houston has chosen to let his skills do the talking rather than relying on any flashy or attention-grabbing name.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at an imposing 185.42cm, Houston towers over many of his opponents in the ring. His height provides him with a significant advantage, allowing him to land punches from a distance and maintain a strong defensive posture. At the same time, Houston's height can also present challenges, as opponents may look to exploit his reach by staying in close and negating his reach advantage. However, Houston has proven time and time again that he is more than capable of using his height to his advantage.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to his fighting style, Houston employs an orthodox stance. This means that he leads with his left hand and foot, and his right hand and foot serve as his power side. The orthodox stance is the most common in boxing and lends itself well to both offensive and defensive strategies. By keeping his weaker hand closer to his opponent, Houston is able to quickly throw jabs and hooks with his lead hand while maintaining a strong defense with his powerful right hand ready to deliver a knockout punch at any moment.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his impressive career, Houston has faced off against some of the toughest opponents in the sport. His ability to adapt and overcome in the ring has garnered him a reputation for being a smart and versatile fighter. Whether facing a relentless aggressive opponent or a crafty counterpuncher, Houston has consistently found a way to come out on top.</p>\n\n<p>One of Houston's greatest strengths is his ability to analyze his opponent's style and adjust his own game plan accordingly. He is known for his exceptional footwork, which allows him to move fluidly around the ring and create angles that give him a tactical advantage. By constantly being in motion and changing his positioning, Houston keeps his opponents guessing and off-balance, making it difficult for them to mount an effective attack.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of Houston's game that sets him apart is his devastating punching power. With each punch, he generates an incredible amount of force, capable of knocking out even the most durable opponents. Houston's power comes from his tremendous strength and precise technique. He focuses on proper weight distribution and hip rotation, ensuring that every punch he throws carries the maximum impact.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond his physical prowess, Houston possesses a mental toughness that is vital in the grueling world of professional boxing. He has faced adversity both inside and outside of the ring and has shown remarkable resilience in bouncing back from defeats and personal challenges. Houston's ability to stay focused and composed under pressure has served him well, allowing him to maintain his competitive edge even in the face of adversity.</p>\n\n<p>One of Houston's most notable victories came in a highly anticipated bout against his longtime rival, Miguel Garcia. The fight showcased Houston's incredible skill and determination as he dominated Garcia throughout the match, ultimately securing a unanimous decision victory. This win solidified Houston's place as one of the top fighters in his division and further cemented his legacy within the sport.</p>\n\n<p>As he continues to showcase his talents in the ring, fans and boxing enthusiasts alike eagerly anticipate what the future holds for Robert Houston. With his impressive height, powerful punches, and unwavering determination, he is sure to continue making waves in the boxing world for years to come.</p>","promoters":null,"trainers":null,"managers":null,"gym":null,"proDebutDate":"1982-04-17","proDivision":"bantam","proWins":0,"proWinsByKnockout":0,"proLosses":1,"proLossesByKnockout":1,"proDraws":1,"proStatus":"inactive","proTotalBouts":2,"proTotalRounds":6,"amateurDebutDate":"","amateurDivision":"","amateurWins":null,"amateurWinsByKnockout":null,"amateurLosses":null,"amateurLossesByKnockout":null,"amateurDraws":null,"amateurStatus":"inactive","amateurTotalBouts":null,"amateurTotalRounds":6,"createdAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:29.723443","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T14:30:29.723446","bouts":"[{\"boxerId\": \"135897\", \"boxrecId\": \"763336\", \"boutDate\": \"Aug 83\", \"opponentName\": \"Juan Ocasio\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Felt Forum, New York\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"loss\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/75119/763336\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"135897\", \"boxrecId\": \"388172\", \"boutDate\": \"Jul 82\", \"opponentName\": \"Pedro Alindato\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Sands Casino Hotel, Atlantic City\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"N\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/22405/388172\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}, {\"boxerId\": \"135897\", \"boxrecId\": \"676569\", \"boutDate\": \"Apr 82\", \"opponentName\": \"Angelo Sanchez\", \"opponentWeight\": null, \"opponentRecord\": null, \"eventName\": \"Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino, Atlantic City\", \"refereeName\": null, \"judge1Name\": null, \"judge1Score\": null, \"judge2Name\": null, \"judge2Score\": null, \"judge3Name\": null, \"judge3Score\": null, \"numRoundsScheduled\": null, \"result\": \"draw\", \"resultMethod\": null, \"resultRound\": null, \"eventPageLink\": null, \"boutPageLink\": \"https://boxrec.com/en/event/27142/676569\", \"scorecardsPageLink\": null, \"titleFight\": false}]"}
