Despite his growing fame, Sanders remained grounded and focused on his craft. He knew that to be remembered as one of the greats, he had to consistently challenge himself against the best competition available.</p>\n\n<p>In 1986, Sanders faced off against the reigning welterweight champion, David \"The Hammer\" Thompson.

Injuries began to take their toll, and he found himself battling with personal issues that affected his training and performance.
