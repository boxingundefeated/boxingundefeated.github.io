His passion for boxing was ignited by his father, who was a celebrated amateur boxer in his own right. Under his father's guidance, Hewitt honed his skills and quickly rose through the ranks of the amateur circuit.</p>\n\n<p>At the age of 19, John Hewitt made the bold decision to turn professional.
