In 2016, he suffered his first professional loss to a seasoned boxer with years of experience under his belt. While some fighters might have been demoralized by such a defeat, Morrison used it as motivation to redouble his efforts and come back even stronger.</p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed, Bobby worked tirelessly to improve his skills, refine his technique, and build mental resilience. He sought guidance from top trainers and sought out sparring partners who could push him to his limits.
