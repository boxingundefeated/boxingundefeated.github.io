Standing at an impressive height of 189cm, Firpo was a towering figure in the boxing ring. With his long reach of 79 inches (or 201cm) and orthodox stance, he proved to be a formidable opponent, particularly in the heavyweight division.</p>

<p>Firpo's career in boxing spanned over several years, and he left a lasting impact on the sport.

As a heavyweight boxer, he competed against some of the biggest names in the sport, leaving a mark with his explosive performances.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable moments in Firpo's career came in 1923 when he faced off against the legendary Jack Dempsey. The bout, often referred to as "The Fight of the Century," took place on September 14 at the Polo Grounds in New York City.

The crowd erupted with excitement, witnessing the relentless onslaught from the underdog.</p>

<p>However, despite Firpo's early dominance, Dempsey proved why he was considered one of the greatest boxers of his time. In the second round, he retaliated with a fierce counterattack that sent Firpo crashing to the canvas. It was a testament to Dempsey's resilience and ability to recover from adversity.</p>

<p>The fight continued to captivate the audience as both fighters exchanged blows with unparalleled intensity.
