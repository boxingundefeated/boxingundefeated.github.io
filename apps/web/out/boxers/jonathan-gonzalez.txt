17:Tf68,<p>Jonathan Gonzalez, also known as "Bomba" and "Mantequilla," is a professional boxer who was born on April 24, 1991. With a height of 180cm and a reach of 160cm, Gonzalez competes in the Light Flyweight weight class. He is a southpaw fighter, meaning he stands with his right hand and right foot forward.</p>

<p>On the other hand, "Mantequilla," which means butter in Spanish, showcases Gonzalez's smooth movements and agility inside the ring. Just like butter, which effortlessly spreads on a slice of bread, Gonzalez glides around his opponents, making it difficult for them to land clean shots.</p>

<p>As a Light Flyweight boxer, Gonzalez competes in one of the lower weight divisions in professional boxing. This weight class is known for its speed and fast-paced action, as fighters in this division possess incredible footwork and hand speed.</p>
