<p>Throughout his career, Cunningham has competed in the cruiserweight and heavyweight weight classes. This speaks volumes about his skill, determination, and willingness to take on new challenges.

He has been praised by his trainers and peers for his work ethic, often putting in long hours of training to hone his skills and maintain his fitness.
