17:T10a3,<p>Hugo "Cuatito" Ruiz is a Mexican professional boxer who was born on September 21, 1986. With a height and reach of 175cm, Ruiz competes in the bantamweight, super bantamweight, and super featherweight weight classes. Known for his orthodox stance and powerful punches, Ruiz has made a name for himself in the world of boxing.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Ruiz has faced numerous opponents in the ring, showcasing his skills and determination. His nickname "Cuatito" adds a personal touch to his persona, reflecting his Mexican heritage and creating a sense of connection with his fans.</p>

<p>As a bantamweight, Ruiz competes in one of the smaller weight classes in boxing. This weight class typically includes fighters who weigh between 118 and 122 pounds. Being a skilled bantamweight boxer requires speed, agility, and accuracy in order to outmaneuver opponents and deliver powerful blows.</p>

<p>Ruiz has also competed in the super bantamweight weight class, which is slightly higher than the bantamweight division. Super bantamweights typically weigh between 122 and 126 pounds. This increased weight allows for more power behind punches, making it crucial for Ruiz to maintain his technique and defensive skills.</p>

<p>In addition to bantamweight and super bantamweight, Ruiz has competed in the super featherweight division. Super featherweights usually weigh between 126 and 130 pounds. This weight class allows for even more power and strength, as the boxers have a slightly higher weight behind their punches.</p>

<p>As an orthodox fighter, Ruiz leads with his left hand and places his left foot forward, mirroring the positioning of most right-handed individuals. This stance allows for powerful right hand punches and provides stability and balance during fights.</p>

<p>Over his long career, Ruiz has proven himself to be a formidable opponent in the boxing ring. His consistent performances and dedication to the sport have earned him respect among fans and fellow fighters. Ruiz continues to train hard and refine his skills, always looking for new ways to improve and overcome any challenges that come his way.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of boxing is a fighter's reach. For Ruiz, his reach matches his height at 175cm. This means he has a fairly average reach compared to other boxers in his weight classes. A boxer's reach can be a huge advantage or disadvantage in the ring, as it determines their ability to land punches from a distance and keep opponents at bay.</p>

<p>When analyzing Ruiz's style and technique in the ring, it is evident that he utilizes his reach effectively. Whether it is his lightning-fast jabs or powerful hooks, Ruiz knows how to capitalize on his reach to inflict damage on his opponents. This ability to maintain distance and control the pace of the fight can often be the key to victory.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Ruiz has faced some tough opponents, each presenting unique challenges.

<p>Ruiz's journey as a professional boxer is far from over, and I am excited to see what the future holds for this talented athlete.
