17:T104d,<p>Dwight Muhammad Qawi, also known by his nickname "Camden Buzzsaw," is a former professional boxer who made a significant impact in the light heavyweight and cruiserweight divisions. Born on January 5, 1953, Qawi stood at a compact height of 166cm but possessed an impressive reach of 180cm. With a strong orthodox stance, Qawi showcased his skills and determination throughout his career.</p>

<p>Qawi's journey in the world of boxing began in the late 1970s when he turned professional. From the start, he caught the attention of boxing enthusiasts with his relentless fighting style and never-give-up attitude. His nickname, the "Camden Buzzsaw," perfectly encapsulated his approach inside the ring - always moving forward, applying relentless pressure, and constantly attacking his opponents.</p>

<p>As a light heavyweight, Qawi faced some of the toughest competition in the division. In his early years, Qawi dominated his opponents, losing only two out of his first twenty-nine fights. His performances were a testament to his skill, determination, and relentless pursuit of victory.</p>

<p>Qawi's breakthrough came in 1981 when he challenged the legendary Matthew Saad Muhammad for the WBC Light Heavyweight title. In a fight filled with back-and-forth action, Qawi displayed his resilience and ability to adapt. Despite being knocked down in the 4th round, he managed to rally back and stop Saad in the 10th round, becoming the new champion.</p>

<p>Qawi's reign as the WBC Light Heavyweight champion was filled with thrilling fights and iconic matchups. He defended his title against the likes of James Scott, Eddie Davis, Michael Spinks, and Saad Muhammad in a rematch. These fights showcased Qawi's ability to brawl on the inside, absorbing punishment while delivering relentless body shots and hooks.</p>

<p>After a successful run as the light heavyweight champion, Qawi made the move up to the cruiserweight division. In this new weight class, Qawi continued to impress, displaying his versatility and adaptability. His style, which proved effective in the light heavyweight division, seamlessly transitioned as he pursued greatness in the cruiserweight division.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable moments in Qawi's career came in 1986 when he faced Evander Holyfield for the WBA Cruiserweight title. Holyfield, a rising star at the time, was expected to dominate Qawi. However, Qawi had other plans. He pushed Holyfield to his limit, engaging in a brutal battle that lasted the full fifteen rounds. In the end, Holyfield narrowly emerged as the victor, winning a split decision. The fight showcased Qawi's heart, determination, and his ability to compete against the very best.</p>

<p>Qawi's career is a testament to his perseverance and his willingness to challenge himself against the toughest opposition. He faced some of the sport's biggest names including Michael Spinks, Leon Spinks, George Foreman, and Evander Holyfield. Despite his relatively small stature for a professional boxer, Qawi's fighting spirit and skillset made him a formidable opponent for anyone.</p>

<p>Beyond his accomplishments inside the ring, Qawi's story is one of triumph over adversity. Growing up in the tough streets of Camden, New Jersey, he faced numerous challenges but found solace and purpose in the sport of boxing. Through his dedication and unwavering determination, Qawi rose above his circumstances and became an inspiration to many.</p>

<p>Qawi's boxing career came to an end in the mid-1990s, but his impact and legacy continue to resonate. Despite facing taller opponents with longer reaches, Qawi's relentless fighting style allowed him to overcome the odds and achieve greatness. He left an indelible mark on the sport, showcasing the power of heart, determination, and the will to succeed.</p>
