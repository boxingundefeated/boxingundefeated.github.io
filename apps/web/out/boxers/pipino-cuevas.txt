17:Td32,<p>Pipino Cuevas, whose birth name is Jose Pipino Cuevas, is a legendary boxer in the welterweight division. With a career that spanned from 1974 to 1988, Cuevas left an indelible mark on the sport with his aggressive style and powerful punches. Born on December 27, 1957, Cuevas hails from Mexico and is widely regarded as one of the greatest welterweight boxers of all time.</p>

<p>Standing at 173cm tall, Cuevas possessed a reach of 178cm, allowing him to effectively utilize his long arms to deliver devastating blows to his opponents. With an orthodox stance, Cuevas would often utilize his jab to set up his trademark power punches. Known for his explosive knockout power, Cuevas earned the nickname "Pipino," a moniker that would become synonymous with his fighting style.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Cuevas amassed an impressive record of 35 wins, 17 losses, and 1 draw. What stood out the most, however, were his knockout victories. Cuevas boasts an astonishing knockout percentage of 80%, with 28 of his wins coming by way of knockout. This statistic speaks volumes of his punching power and highlights why he was a feared opponent in the ring.</p>

<p>One of Cuevas' most memorable fights took place on May 5, 1976, when he faced Angel Espada for the WBA welterweight title. Cuevas, hungry for championship glory, wasted no time and unleashed a relentless assault on Espada from the first bell. It was a brutal display of power as Cuevas eventually knocked out Espada in the second round, claiming the WBA welterweight title and solidifying his status as a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>However, Cuevas' reign as champion would not last forever. In his second title defense, Cuevas faced the legendary "Sugar" Ray Leonard on September 16, 1978. This clash of two top welterweights captivated the boxing world. Cuevas, known for his aggressive style, was expected to bring the fight to Leonard. However, it was Leonard's speed and agility that proved to be the deciding factor.</p>

<p>Leonard showcased his exceptional footwork and lightning-fast hands, frustrating Cuevas at every turn. In the second round, Leonard landed a devastating flurry of punches that sent Cuevas to the canvas, ultimately leading to a TKO victory for Leonard. Despite the loss, Cuevas' courage and determination never wavered, earning him the respect of fans and fellow boxers alike.</p>

<p>After his defeat to Leonard, Cuevas continued to compete at the highest level but was unable to reclaim the welterweight title. He retired from professional boxing in 1988, leaving behind a legacy that will forever be etched in the annals of the sport. Cuevas' aggressive style and punching power continue to inspire young boxers to this day.</p>

<p>Outside the ring, Cuevas is known for his humble and down-to-earth personality. Despite his achievements in the sport, he has remained grounded and approachable, always willing to share his knowledge and experiences with aspiring fighters.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Pipino Cuevas, with his explosive power and relentless aggression, left an indelible mark on the world of boxing. His knockout victories and thrilling fights will forever be remembered in the hearts of boxing fans. Cuevas' legacy as one of the greatest welterweights of all time is a testament to his skill, determination, and unwavering commitment to the sport he loved.</p>e:["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4
