17:Te75,<p>Demetrius "Boo Boo" Andrade is a professional boxer who was born on February 26, 1988. With a height of 183cm and a reach of 187cm, Andrade possesses the physical attributes that make him a formidable opponent in the super middleweight division.</p>

<p>Andrade is known for his southpaw stance, which gives him a unique advantage in the ring. His ability to throw punches from different angles and create awkward angles for his opponents can often leave them perplexed and struggling to find their rhythm.</p>

<p>Having competed in the super middleweight weight class, Andrade weighs in at 76.2kg. This weight allows him to maintain his strength and power while also remaining agile and quick on his feet.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Andrade has showcased his boxing skills and athleticism. He possesses a burstiness that allows him to explode with power in his punches, catching his opponents off guard and often leading to impressive knockouts. His combination of speed, accuracy, and power make him a force to be reckoned with in the ring.</p>

<p>Despite his undeniable talent and skill, Andrade has faced some challenges in his career. One of the main obstacles he has encountered is the lack of high-profile opponents. Despite holding the WBO middleweight and super welterweight titles, Andrade has struggled to secure fights against some of the top names in the sport.</p>

<p>However, Andrade has proven time and time again that he is willing to take on any opponent and showcase his abilities. He has faced a range of opponents with different styles and has consistently come out on top. This determination and willingness to step into the ring against anyone demonstrate his dedication to his craft and his goal of becoming one of the best in the business.</p>

<p>Andrade's boxing style is a combination of finesse and power. He relies on his technical skills to outbox his opponents, but he is also not afraid to engage in close-quarters combat and throw powerful punches. His ability to seamlessly switch between different strategies and adjust his game plan to exploit his opponents' weaknesses is what sets him apart from many other fighters in his weight class.</p>

<p>One of Andrade's most significant victories came in 2018 when he defeated Walter Kautondokwa to become the WBO middleweight champion. Andrade showcased his offensive and defensive skills, dominating the fight and winning by unanimous decision. This victory solidified his position as one of the top fighters in the middleweight division.</p>

<p>Andrade's journey in the boxing world has not been without its setbacks. In 2019, he was stripped of his WBO middleweight title due to managerial issues and was subsequently unable to secure a unification fight against other champions in the division. This setback, however, did not deter Andrade from his ultimate goal of becoming a unified champion.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges he has faced, Andrade remains a poised and focused fighter. He continues to train diligently, always looking for opportunities to showcase his skills and prove himself against the best in the sport. His hunger for success and his relentless pursuit of greatness make him an intriguing figure in the world of boxing.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Demetrius "Boo Boo" Andrade is a highly talented boxer who has made a name for himself in the super middleweight division. With his unique southpaw stance, burstiness, and technical skills, Andrade has proven himself to be a formidable opponent for anyone who steps into the ring with him. While he may face challenges in securing high-profile fights, Andrade remains determined to cement his legacy as one of the best in the business.</p>e:["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto
