<p>With a nickname like "The Matrix," one can expect Matet to display exceptional speed and agility in his movements. Just like the fictional character from the popular movie franchise, Matet seems to effortlessly evade his opponents' attacks with grace and fluidity. His footwork is a sight to behold, as he swiftly glides around the ring, always staying one step ahead of his opponents.</p>

<p>Matet's reach of 71Â½" (182cm) further adds to his arsenal. It allows him to maintain a safe distance from his opponents while still being able to land powerful punches. This reach advantage often forces his opponents to lunge forward, exposing themselves to Matet's counterattacks.</p>

Utilizing his agility and footwork, he seamlessly slips and ducks away from punches, frustrating his opponents and making it difficult for them to land clean shots.
