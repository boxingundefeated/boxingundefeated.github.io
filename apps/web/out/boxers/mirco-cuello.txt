<p>Standing at a height of 170cm, Cuello possesses a reach that matches his height, allowing him to effectively utilize his boxing style.

Burstiness refers to his ability to unleash powerful combinations and quick flurries of punches, catching his opponents off guard and overwhelming them with his speed and accuracy. His impressive footwork allows him to close the distance quickly and create openings for his explosive attacks.</p>

<p>But it's not just Cuello's burstiness that sets him apart. He also possesses a perplexing style that perplexes and confuses his opponents. With his strategic approach to the sport, Cuello has the ability to adapt and adjust his game plan as the fight progresses, leaving his opponents guessing and struggling to find an effective strategy to counter his moves.</p>
