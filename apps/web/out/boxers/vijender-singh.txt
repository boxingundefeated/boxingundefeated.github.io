17:Td32,<p>Meet Vijender Singh, the Indian boxing sensation who has taken the sport by storm. Born on October 29, 1985, in Bhiwani, India, Vijender has established himself as one of the most successful boxers to come out of India. With a height of 183cm and a reach of 193cm, he possesses the physical attributes necessary to thrive in the ring.</p>

<p>Standing in the orthodox stance, Vijender competes in the middleweight division, weighing in at 75kg. His discipline and dedication to his craft have seen him achieve remarkable success, both at the amateur and professional levels.</p>

<p>Vijender started his boxing journey at the age of 16, training at the Bhiwani Boxing Club under the guidance of coach Jagdish Singh. He quickly made a name for himself, winning numerous medals at the national and international levels as an amateur. In fact, he became the first Indian boxer to win a medal at the Olympics when he secured a bronze in the middleweight division at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This historic achievement not only propelled him into the spotlight but also inspired a generation of young Indian boxers.</p>

<p>After a successful amateur career, Vijender made the decision to turn professional in 2015. He signed with the Queensberry Promotions, a British boxing promotion company, and embarked on a new chapter in his boxing journey. His transition to the professional ranks was seamless, as he continued to showcase his skills, power, and determination inside the ring.</p>

<p>Vijender's professional record speaks for itself. He has an impressive undefeated record, with a perfect 12-0 record, including eight knockouts. His relentless work ethic and unwavering commitment to his training have allowed him to consistently perform at the highest level.</p>

<p>One of Vijender's most memorable fights came in 2016 when he faced Kerry Hope for the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title. The fight took place in front of an electric crowd in New Delhi, India. Vijender, feeding off the energy of the crowd, put on a dominant performance, defeating Hope via unanimous decision to claim the title. This victory further solidified his position as one of India's top boxers.</p>

<p>Vijender's success extends beyond the boxing ring. His charisma and charm have made him a beloved figure in India. He has also utilized his platform to advocate for important social issues, such as women's empowerment and the eradication of drug abuse. Vijender's influence extends far beyond his boxing accomplishments, as he continues to inspire and uplift those around him.</p>

<p>As Vijender continues his professional career, fans eagerly anticipate his next move. His dedication to his craft, coupled with his natural talent, makes him a force to be reckoned with in the middleweight division. With each fight, he demonstrates his growth as a boxer and his unwavering determination to achieve greatness.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Vijender Singh's journey from a young boy in Bhiwani to becoming one of India's boxing icons is a testament to his hard work, skill, and passion for the sport. His success in both the amateur and professional ranks has brought immense pride to India and has inspired countless aspiring boxers. As he continues to make waves in the middleweight division, Vijender's impact on Indian boxing will undoubtedly be remembered for generations to come.</p>e:["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl
