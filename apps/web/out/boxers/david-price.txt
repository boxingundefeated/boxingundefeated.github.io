Born on July 6, 1983, Price has been a formidable force in the sport, capturing the attention of fans and pundits alike with his explosive power and skill. Standing at an impressive 203cm and boasting a reach of 208cm, Price's physical attributes have often given him an edge over his opponents in the ring.</p>

<p>Although he may not have any official nicknames, Price has earned a reputation as a fearsome knockout artist.
