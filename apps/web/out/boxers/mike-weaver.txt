17:Tfdf,<p>When it comes to heavyweight boxing, one name that cannot be forgotten is Mike Weaver, also known as "Hercules." Born on June 13, 1951, Weaver made a significant impact on the boxing world during his prime. Standing tall at 185cm with a reach of 198cm, Weaver was a force to be reckoned with in the heavyweight division.</p>

<p>Weaver's nickname, "Hercules," perfectly encapsulates his immense strength and power inside the ring. He possessed a rare combination of speed, agility, and knockout power, which made him a dangerous opponent for anyone who stepped into the squared circle with him.</p>

<p>With an orthodox stance, Weaver utilized his reach advantage to keep his opponents at bay while setting up devastating combinations. His ability to deliver powerful punches from a distance often caught his opponents off guard, leading to many memorable knockout victories.</p>

<p>Speaking of knockout victories, Weaver had an impressive record in the heavyweight division. Throughout his career, he scored a staggering 24 knockouts out of his total of 41 wins. This is a testament to his exceptional punching power and his ability to finish off his opponents in style.</p>

<p>One of the most notable fights in Weaver's career came when he faced John Tate for the WBA Heavyweight title on March 31, 1980. It was an epic battle between two heavyweight contenders, with both fighters showcasing their skills and determination. Weaver was able to secure a victory in the 15th round by delivering a devastating left hook that sent Tate crashing to the canvas.</p>

It showcased his ability to go the distance and deliver a knockout blow when it mattered most. The fight with Tate was a turning point in Weaver's career, propelling him to new heights in the boxing world.</p>

<p>However, Weaver's reign as the WBA Heavyweight champion was not without its challenges. In his first title defense against Mike Dokes, he faced a tough opponent who pushed him to his limits. Despite his best efforts, Weaver lost the fight via a controversial decision.</p>

<p>But Weaver's resilience and determination were unmatched. He made a spectacular comeback by defeating the legendary boxing icon, Gerrie Coetzee, to claim the WBA Heavyweight title once again. This victory showcased Weaver's ability to bounce back from adversity and reclaim his position at the top of the boxing hierarchy.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Weaver faced and defeated many formidable opponents, including former world champions such as James Tillis and Ernie Shavers. His relentless fighting style and knockout power struck fear into the hearts of his opponents.</p>

<p>Weaver's boxing journey serves as an inspiration to aspiring fighters, as he proved that hard work, dedication, and tenacity can lead to great success. Despite facing setbacks and challenges, he never gave up and continued to push forward, eventually leaving a lasting legacy in the sport of boxing.</p>

<p>Although Weaver's professional boxing career may have ended, his influence and impact on the sport will never be forgotten. His ability to captivate audiences with his explosive knockouts and fearless attitude inside the ring made him a fan favorite.</p>

<p>For those who had the privilege of witnessing Weaver's fights, they were treated to a spectacle of power and skill that will be remembered for years to come.</p>
