<p>One of the things that sets Hoffman apart from other fighters is her versatility. She has proven herself as both a skilled offensive and defensive boxer, able to adapt her style to the demands of any opponent. Her lightning-fast footwork allows her to evade punches and counter with precision, while her powerful punches can knock out even the toughest of adversaries.</p>
