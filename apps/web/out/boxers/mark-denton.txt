Denton has shown remarkable mental strength and resilience, traits that are essential for success in the unforgiving world of professional boxing.</p>

<p>Despite his young age and relative inexperience compared to some of the more established names in the sport, Denton has already garnered a loyal fan base. People are drawn to his fighting style, his dedication to the sport, and his humble personality. Denton is not one to engage in trash talk or boast about his abilities. Instead, he lets his performances speak for themselves.</p>
