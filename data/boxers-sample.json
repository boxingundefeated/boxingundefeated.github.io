Standing at 170.18cm in height, he may not be the tallest boxer, but his reach of 68.0 inches (173cm) more than makes up for it. At a weight of 70.31kg, Turner exemplifies the discipline and dedication required to compete at a high level in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>Known for his aggressive style and powerful punches, Turner has earned his nickname \"The Axeman.\" Just like an ax wielded with precision and force, Turner's punches can deliver devastating blows to his opponents. His ability to generate power from his compact frame has made him a force to be reckoned with in the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Turner's height may not provide him with a natural advantage when facing taller opponents, but his reach compensates for it.

Boxing requires not only skill and technique, but also endurance and strength. Turner's commitment to his training regimen ensures that he is always in top form when he steps into the ring.</p>\n\n<p>But Turner's journey to becoming a professional boxer was not without its challenges.
