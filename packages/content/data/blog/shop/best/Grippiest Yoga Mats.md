### [Premium Grippy Yoga Mat for Extra Comfort and Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[I was on the hunt for a new yoga mat last month when a friend recommended the Gaiam Essentials](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) Thick Yoga Mat. I have to say, I've never felt more comfort and support during my yoga sessions. The extra-thick 1cm foam provides cushioning for my knees and wrists, and it's surprisingly lightweight and easy to carry around with the included carrying strap.

One of the things that stood out most to me about this mat is its durability. I've been using it for almost a month now, and it still looks brand new, despite being dragged to and from the gym several times a week. The non-slip ridges on the surface of the mat have also been a welcome feature; they give me extra grip during downward dogs and other challenging poses.

However, one downside I encountered with this mat is that it tends to squeak when I move between poses on damp feet. This can be a little distracting during yoga classes, but I've found that wiping it down with a damp cloth before use helps to minimize the noise.

In addition to its durability and grip, I also love the variety of colors this mat comes in. I opted for the bold red one, but there are plenty of other options to suit any style. Overall, the Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat has been a game-changer for my yoga practice, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new mat.

### [ProSource Ultra-Thick Mandala Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats)

The ProSource Printed Yoga Mat with its captivating mandala design has been my trusted companion during my yoga sessions. Its vibrant colors and striking pattern draw me in every time I unfurl the mat. As soon as I step onto it, the non-slip surface ensures that I remain stable during poses like downward-facing dog and warrior poses. Not only did it provide comfort to my aching joints, but its 5mm thickness also offered adequate support.

One of my favorite features? Its lightweight nature! Weighing less than three pounds, I can effortlessly roll it up for storage or take it along for yoga classes. I found this mat perfect for various floor exercises like core workouts, push-ups, and stretching, making it a versatile addition to my fitness routine.

While initial use did bring out a mild plastic scent, leaving it outside for air helped dissipate that quickly. The PVC material used is not only eco-friendly but also assures a safe environment for your practice. So whether you're a beginner or an advanced yogi, the ProSource Printed Yoga Mat Mandala is sure to enhance your practice with its blend of style, comfort, and durability.

### [AIREX Calyana Prime Yoga Mat, 26" x 73" x 0.2](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img alt="airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, there are a couple of minor cons. Firstly, the mat can be a bit heavy for some, especially if you don't have much upper body strength. Secondly, while the grip is good overall, it might not be sticky enough for some intense, sweat-inducing workouts.

All in all, I absolutely love the AIREX Calyana Yoga Mat. It's durable, comfortable, and versatile - everything one could ask for in a yoga mat!

### [Sturdy and Comfortable 71"x24" Yoga Mat with Knee Pad](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img alt="balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the BalanceFrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat to enhance my yoga practice. It has been a game-changer for me, as it provides ample cushioning and support on hard floors, making deep stretches and poses much more comfortable. Additionally, the double-sided non-slip surface ensures stability during intense sessions, leaving me worry-free about slipping during those challenging balancing poses.

Throughout months of consistent use, the mat's moisture-wicking technology has prevented any lingering odors or stains, keeping the mat fresh and clean. The included knee pad and yoga blocks have also proven to be extremely helpful, offering added protection for my joints when trying out new and more demanding poses.

However, one minor drawback is that the mat tends to curl slightly at the ends due to the straps tightening over time. Despite this, I can confidently recommend the BalanceFrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat as an essential piece of equipment for any serious yoga enthusiast.

## FAQ

### 1. What makes a yoga mat grippy?

A yoga mat's grip is determined by its texture, material, and thickness. Grippy mats often have a textured surface that creates friction between the mat and the user's hands and feet. This enables better traction and stability during yoga practice.

### 2. Are grippy yoga mats suitable for beginners?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grippiest+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Grippiest Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

Yes, grippy yoga mats are suitable for beginners as they provide better traction, making it easier to maintain balance during yoga poses, especially for those who are new to the practice.

### 3. How do grippy yoga mats compare to other mats in terms of performance?

Grippy yoga mats excel in performance by providing users with enhanced stability and traction during their yoga practice, compared to mats with less grip. This can also help prevent injuries, as the risk of slipping is reduced.

### 4. Can I use grippy yoga mats for other exercise routines?

While grippy yoga mats are primarily designed for yoga practice, they can also be used for other exercise routines that require good grip and traction, such as Pilates or bodyweight training.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grippiest+Yoga+Mats-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Grippiest Yoga Mats-5"></a></div>

### 5. Are all grippy yoga mats created equal?

Not all grippy yoga mats are the same, as manufacturers use different materials and designs to create their mats. [Some might offer better grip, while others may focus on features like cushioning and portability.](https://best.serp.co/shop/hand-grip-strengthener/) It is essential to read reviews and compare features to determine which mat is the best fit for your needs.

### 6. How do I clean a grippy yoga mat?

To clean a grippy yoga mat, wipe it using a damp cloth and mild soap after each use. You can also make a homemade cleaning solution by mixing water, white vinegar, and a few drops of tea tree or [lavender essential oil](https://best.serp.co/shop/lavender-essential-oils/). Ensure that your mat is thoroughly dried before storing it to prevent odor and mildew buildup.

### 7. How can I increase the grip of a yoga mat that is starting to get slippery?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/grippiest-yoga-mats"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grippiest+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Grippiest Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

To increase the grip of a yoga mat, you can apply a thin layer of textured spray or yoga mat cleaner designed to enhance traction. You can also sprinkle a small amount of baking soda or cornstarch on your mat and rub it briefly with a clean cloth, then vacuum the residue away to remove excess oil and enhance grip.

### 8. How thick should a grippy yoga mat be for optimal performance?

A moderate thickness of around 3mm to 6mm is ideal for grippy yoga mats. Thinner mats provide better grip and stability, while thicker ones offer more cushioning and support for knees and joints. Most users find that mats within this thickness range offer a good balance between grip and comfort.

### 9. Are there any materials to avoid when choosing a grippy yoga mat?

It is best to avoid synthetic materials like PVC, as these can be unhealthy for you and the environment. Instead, opt for eco-friendly materials like natural rubber, jute, or cork, which offer better grip and are more sustainable.

### 10. How do I store a grippy yoga mat to maintain its grip?

To maintain the grip of a yoga mat, make sure it is clean and dry before rolling it up and storing it. Store your mat in a cool, dry place to prevent odor and mildew buildup. Avoid exposing your yoga mat to extreme temperatures or sunlight, as these can damage the surface and reduce its grip over time.
