In conclusion, if you're someone who struggles with keeping up with their daily hydration goals, the Zulu Goals Jug might just be the perfect companion for you.

### Portability

Consider the overall size and weight of the 60 oz water bottle, as well as any additional features like carabiner hooks or carry handles. These will affect how easily you can transport the bottle in different situations.
