The bottle holds 2 liters or 64 ounces, allowing me to drink water throughout the day without needing to refill it. I particularly love the time marker on the bottle, which has a motivational quote and helps me track my water intake. The wide-mouth opening makes it easy to fill with [ice cubes](https://best.serp.co/shop/ice-cubes/) and clean, but I do wish it had a wider base for added stability.

Plus, the straw makes it super easy to drink from, and I love the motivational quote on the bottle for an extra boost of inspiration.

On the downside, the handle could be sturdier, as it tends to loosen up with regular use. Additionally, I wish the bottle was dishwasher-safe for easier cleaning.
