### [64oz Hydra Water Jug with Straw - Gray](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/64-oz-water-bottle-with-straw)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/64-oz-water-bottle-with-straw"><img alt="ello-hydra-64oz-half-gallon-plastic-jug-with-straw-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-hydra-64oz-half-gallon-plastic-jug-with-straw-gray-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Ello Hydra 64oz Half Gallon Plastic Jug with Straw in Gray, I have to say it's been quite a journey. The first thing that struck me about this jug is its size - it's so big that I don't have to get up every now and then to refill my water bottle!

The time marker on the side really helps me keep track of when I should drink water throughout the day. It's like having my own personal assistant reminding me to stay hydrated. Another feature I absolutely love is the one-touch flip lid. It keeps my drink surface covered and clean, which is an added bonus when you're constantly on the go.

The extra wide opening makes filling up with ice or cleaning a breeze. And speaking of convenience, the choice between using the integrated carry loop or the soft-touch handle on the side for easy grab-and-go is a game-changer.

However, there are some downsides to this product. There have been instances where it has leaked, which can be quite inconvenient if you're carrying it. Additionally, despite being labeled as 'insulated', it does not keep my water cold for an extended period of time.

In terms of aesthetics, the Gray color is quite neutral and blends well with most surroundings. However, some users may prefer bolder colors or designs.

Despite its flaws, the Ello Hydra Jug with Straw is an efficient way to stay hydrated throughout the day. It's especially beneficial for those who are always on the go. But remember, this product isn't perfect and you might experience some leakage issues or lack of insulation as I did.

All in all, the Ello Hydra Jug with Straw is a decent choice if you're looking for a large water bottle that also serves as a motivational tool to drink more water. Just be prepared for some minor hiccups along the way.
