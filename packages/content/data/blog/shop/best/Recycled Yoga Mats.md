### [5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="life-energy-5mm-ekosmart-cork-yoga-mat-with-yoga-strap-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/life-energy-5mm-ekosmart-cork-yoga-mat-with-yoga-strap-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got to try out the Life Energy 5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap and it has quickly become my favorite yoga accessory. As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried various mats but nothing compares to the grip, comfort, and eco-friendliness of this Life Energy cork mat.

The high point for me was the non-slip cork surface. It's amazing how it becomes even more stable with heat and sweat, providing the best grip for any pose. This quality is particularly useful during hot yoga sessions when most mats would be slippery from all the sweat.

Another feature that stood out was its eco-friendliness. Being made from sustainable materials like cork and TPE, it doesn't contain any harmful chemicals or smells. Plus, it's recyclable which is a big plus for those concerned about the impact of their purchases on the environment.

However, one minor downside is the weight of the mat. It's slightly heavier than traditional mats due to the thickness of the cork but the included yoga strap helps make it easier to carry around.

Overall, the Life Energy 5mm EkoSmart Cork Yoga Mat with Yoga Strap has definitely stepped up my yoga game. Its eco-friendliness, non-slip surface, and comfortable cushioning make it an excellent choice for any yoga enthusiast looking to enhance their practice.

### [Sol Living Extra Thick Non-Slip Yoga Mat in Grey](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="sol-living-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-in-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sol-living-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-in-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have to say, the Sol Living Natural Rubber Yoga Mat in Grey has been a game-changer in my daily workout routine. The minute I unrolled it, I was greeted with a sense of comfort and luxury. Its thick surface not only gives me substantial cushioning, but it also offers a non-slip grip that makes it incredibly comfortable to practice any yoga pose. I've been especially thrilled about the grey color, which gives off a zen-like, smooth and delightful vibe to my practice space.

Additionally, the mat is moisture-resistant, making it a perfect companion for hot yoga sessions. Besides yoga, this natural rubber mat also doubles as an excellent [exercise mat](https://best.serp.co/shop/exercise-mat/) for other floor exercises, providing a steady, non-slip surface for balance and comfort.

However, there's one thing that does require a bit of effort - maintenance. The mat, being made of natural rubber, needs a gentle touch for cleaning. It's best to wipe it down with a soft damp cloth for a clean, slip-free surface, and an overall enjoyable workout experience.

In conclusion, the Sol Living Natural Rubber Yoga Mat in Grey has made my yoga practice not just more comfortable, but also more enjoyable. Its thickness, texture, and color all contribute to a sense of luxury and serenity in my space. A must-have for any yoga enthusiast.

### [Eco-Friendly Recycled Wetsuit Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="suga-recycled-wetsuit-yoga-mat-non-slip-recycled-made-in-usa-regular-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/suga-recycled-wetsuit-yoga-mat-non-slip-recycled-made-in-usa-regular-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's been practicing yoga for years, finding the perfect mat has always been a challenge. But I must say, my experience with the Suga Recycled Wetsuit Yoga Mat has been a game-changer. This lightweight mat, made from recycled wetsuits, proved to be an exceptional travel companion. Its thinner design allows it to roll up smaller than most mats, making it ideal for those blissful yogic travel adventures.

The non-slip surface is another highlight. Despite being so light, it provides just enough grip to keep me steady during even the most intense asana practice. And knowing that I'm using a product that's eco-friendly and fully recyclable at the end of its life puts my mind at ease.

However, there are a few downsides. The mat isn't designed for daily studio use, so it may not wear as well with consistent use. And during hot yoga sessions, I did notice some flaking. But the quick response and outstanding customer service from Suga Mats made this minor inconvenience worthwhile.

All in all, if you're looking for an eco-friendly yoga mat that's perfect for travel and easy to roll up, the Suga Recycled Wetsuit Yoga Mat is definitely worth considering. Just remember to use it primarily for travel and give it some extra love during those hot yoga sessions.

### [Serene Anahata Yoga Mat for Eco-Warriors](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="100-eco-friendly-pu-yoga-mat-sahasrara-shakti-warrior-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/100-eco-friendly-pu-yoga-mat-sahasrara-shakti-warrior-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using my Sahasrara Anahata Yoga Mat from Shakti Warrior for the past month, and I absolutely love it. As a yogi trying to balance my practice with life's daily stresses, this mat has been a real game-changer. The design is not only incredibly attractive but also eco-friendly, which is a significant plus for me.

One of the features that has really stood out is the grip quality. No matter how intense my practice gets, I don't find myself sliding all over the place. This is incredibly important for maintaining stability and focus during my sessions. The comfort level is also top-notch, with the right amount of cushioning to support my joints during various poses.

However, there's one downside that I've noticed - durability. While the mat looks great initially, I've noticed that it starts peeling and showing signs of wear relatively early on. Another con could be the slightly high price point compared to other mats in the market.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Sahasrara Anahata Yoga Mat to anyone looking to add a touch of elegance and functionality to their yoga routine. Its eye-catching design, excellent grip quality, and comfort make it worth every penny, despite minor durability issues.

### [Extra Thick Eco-Friendly Reversible Yoga Mat for Superior Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

I recently picked up a COCOBELA yoga mat for my daily practice sessions, and I must say, this eco-friendly mat has become a game-changer. The extra thick TPE construction offers great cushioning and support, making it incredibly comfortable, even for those with knees or joints that require extra care. Plus, its dual-sided design adds a touch of personalization to your practice, with two unique colors and textures to choose from.

One of the standout features of this mat is its no-slip, textured surface for superior traction, which has helped me stay grounded and focused during my yoga sessions. Not to mention, it's incredibly easy to clean - the closed cell design seals out odors and bacteria, keeping it fresh and hygienic with minimal effort.

The only downside I've experienced is that it might be a little thinner than advertised for some users, but for me, the thickness is perfect. Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with my COCOBELA yoga mat, and I believe it has elevated my practice to new heights.

### [Reversible Yoga Mat for Eco-Warriors](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="natural-fitness-eco-smart-yoga-mat-moss-night-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/natural-fitness-eco-smart-yoga-mat-moss-night-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Natural Fitness Eco-Smart Yoga Mat is a fitness essential that's perfect for environmentally-conscious yogis. I've been using this mat for a few months now and absolutely love it. The surface has great grip, giving me a stable base for my practice. Plus, the material is eco-friendly and doesn't release any unpleasant odors.

One thing that's really stood out about this mat is its portability. It's easy to carry around and unrolls quickly without any hassle. However, I must say that the mattress could use some improvement in terms of thickness. I often find myself needing extra padding during floor postures.

Now, onto the cleaning process. I'm happy to report that keeping this mat clean has been a breeze. A little soap and water are all you need to get rid of any dirt or sweat. And, unlike some cheaper mats, the quality of craftsmanship on this one is top-notch.

Overall, I highly recommend the Natural Fitness Eco-Smart Yoga Mat for anyone looking for an eco-friendly option that performs exceptionally well. It's stylish, easy to maintain, and most importantly, it provides a comfortable surface for all your yoga needs. But remember, it might not be the best choice if you're looking for extra cushioning.

### [Eco-Lux 17mm Recycled Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="merrithew-eco-lux-imprint-pro-yoga-mat-black-17mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/merrithew-eco-lux-imprint-pro-yoga-mat-black-17mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Merrithew Eco-Lux Imprint Pro Yoga Mat for my home workouts, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer! The thicker design provides an incredible level of comfort and support, making even the toughest yoga sessions feel like a breeze. After spending some time with it, I can definitely see why it's a favorite among fitness professionals and boutique studios.

One standout feature is the mat's craftsmanship. It's made with a blend of recycled rubber and polyurethane, which not only makes it eco-friendly but also gives it an impressive level of durability. The surface has just the right amount of grip, so I never have to worry about slipping during downward dog or any other high-intensity poses.

However, there are a few things that could be improved. Firstly, the mat emits a noticeable odor when you first unroll it - not the most pleasant scent, but it does dissipate over time. Secondly, while the thickness is great for comfort, it can be a bit challenging to roll up and put away after a workout. But overall, the Merrithew Eco-Lux Imprint Pro Yoga Mat has undoubtedly enhanced my home workout experience!

### [Eco-Friendly BetterGrip Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img alt="clever-yoga-mat-bettergrip-eco-friendly-with-the-best-recyclable-non-slip-and-or-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/clever-yoga-mat-bettergrip-eco-friendly-with-the-best-recyclable-non-slip-and-or-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I must say, I've been doing yoga for years but I never found the perfect mat until I came across the Clever Yoga Mat BetterGrip Eco-Friendly. This mat has truly revolutionized my practice on so many levels. First off, let me tell you about its incredible lightweight design - at only 2 pounds, it's half the weight of my previous mat! I used to dread lugging my old mat to and from classes, but this one is so easy to carry around.

One of the things I love most about the Clever Yoga Mat is its unparalleled comfort. The ultra-cushioned 6mm thickness provides ample support for my knees and elbows during those tough poses. Plus, the surface is moisture-resistant, making it a breeze to clean. After a sweaty yoga session, all you need to do is wipe it down with a wet soft cloth or hose it off - so simple!

And let's talk about the materials of this mat. Made from 100% recyclable and eco-friendly TPE, it's completely free of harmful chemicals like PVC, phthalates, silicone, and latex. Not only does this make for a safer practice environment, but it also ensures that your mat won't absorb any unpleasant odors.

Its non-slip properties are truly remarkable as well. Even in particularly intense sessions or during those hot summer days, I never have to worry about losing my grip. The Clever Yoga Mat has provided me with unwavering support and stability throughout my practice.

One minor drawback I noticed is that the mat does take a little longer to dry compared to others. However, considering all the other amazing features it offers, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Clever Yoga Mat BetterGrip Eco-Friendly to anyone in search of a high-quality, eco-friendly yoga mat.

## Buyer's Guide

### Important Features

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/recycled-yoga-mats"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Recycled+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Recycled Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

When considering a recycled yoga mat, it's essential to look for specific features that enhance your practice. The ideal mat should provide good cushioning for joint protection and skid-resistance to ensure proper alignment during poses. It should also be easy to clean and maintain without compromising its quality or integrity.

### Material Matters

Recycled yoga mats are typically made from materials like recycled PVC, TPE, or rubber. Each material offers unique benefits. For instance, recycled PVC is known for its durability and grip, while recycled rubber might offer more cushioning and eco-friendliness. Choose a material that aligns with your needs and preferences.

### Consideration: Thickness & Cushioning

Recycled yoga mats vary in thickness, ranging from 1/16th inch to about 1/4 inch. Thicker mats offer greater cushioning, minimizing strain on joints during practice. However, they can also add weight and bulkiness. If you have sensitive joints, opt for a thicker mat. If you prioritize portability, consider a thinner one.

### Advice: Prioritize Grip and Non-Slip Features

The importance of grip and non-slip features cannot be overstated in a yoga mat. A good quality recycled yoga mat should provide sufficient traction to prevent slipping. This feature is especially crucial for fast-paced or intense practices like vinyasa or hot yoga. Look for mats with textured surfaces or specialized grip technologies.

### Maintenance and Durability

Recycled yoga mats require specific care to maintain their quality. Check the manufacturer's cleaning instructions and ensure they align with your care routine. Some mats can be cleaned with mild soap and water, while others may need special cleaning products. Durability also plays a role; invest in a mat that can withstand regular usage without deteriorating prematurely.
