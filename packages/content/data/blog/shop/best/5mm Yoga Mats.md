### [Marrakesh Print 5mm Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

[Get ready to strike a pose with Gaiam's Printed Marrakesh Yoga Mat!](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) This vibrant 5mm mat features a delicate printed medallion pattern that adds a touch of zen to your practice. The medium thickness provides ample cushioning for your joints while maintaining stability during even the most intense flows.

I personally love the Marrakesh Yoga Mat for its comfortable feel and beautiful design. The colors are vibrant and really help set the mood for a calming yoga session. The non-slip surface has been a game-changer in my practice, keeping me stable and secure during those tricky balancing poses.

However, there are a few small drawbacks to consider. Some users have mentioned receiving a different design than what they ordered, which can be discouraging. Additionally, the strong odor it emits upon first use can be off-putting for some, but I found that airing it out for a few days helped significantly.

In conclusion, if you're looking to invest in a stylish and practical yoga mat that offers great support and comfort, Gaiam's Printed Marrakesh Yoga Mat is definitely worth considering. Just make sure to verify the design before placing your order and give it time to air out before your first use.

### [Alo Yoga Mat with Superior Grip and Portability for Fitness Enthusiasts](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="all-in-motion-natural-rubber-pu-5mm-yoga-mat-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/all-in-motion-natural-rubber-pu-5mm-yoga-mat-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I tried the All in Motion Natural Rubber Yoga Mat and my experience was nothing short of amazing. The mat is thick, provides excellent support, and has a fantastic grip that prevents sliding during yoga poses. Plus, it's easy to clean and just as impressive as some of the more expensive yoga mats I've used.

One standout feature is the mat's thickness. At 5mm, it's not only comfortable but also provides nice cushioning during hardwood floor sessions. However, this also makes it a bit heavier than typical mats, which is something to keep in mind if you plan to carry it to classes.

Another great aspect is the grip. It's perfect for maintaining balance during different poses, and even during hot yoga when sweat makes holding positions difficult. The only minor downside I noticed was that the branding in the center of the mat might irk some who prefer a minimalistic design, but that's personal preference.

In conclusion, the All in Motion Yoga Mat is a solid pick for its price. It offers excellent performance, durability, and comfort, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned yogis alike. Despite its weight, the high-quality construction and support make it a worthwhile addition to any home or gym practice.

### [Everyday Yoga Mat, 72'' x 5mm, Dusty Rose](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="everyday-yoga-mat-72-inch-5mm-dusty-rose-pvc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/everyday-yoga-mat-72-inch-5mm-dusty-rose-pvc-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Everyday Yoga Mat I've been using for the past month has been a game-changer in my mindfulness practice. From its soft and vibrant dusty rose color to its impressive thick 5mm, it's a joy to look at and use. One feature that stands out is its sticky grip with use. Unlike some mats that become slippery over time, this one maintains its grip, allowing me to maintain steady yoga poses without sliding. It's also made of 100% PVC, free from 16 phthalates, ensuring that my practice is not only effective but also environmentally friendly.

However, as with any product, there are a few cons. Firstly, the yoga mat needed a bit of time to off-gas, which left it with a mild chemical smell for a few days before I started using it. Secondly, while the mat provides a comfortable cushioning, it does not have the same level of thickness and support as more expensive mats.

Overall, this yoga mat has been a solid addition to my practice, providing comfort and stability without breaking the bank. It's especially suitable for beginners who might not be sure about investing in a more expensive mat just yet. So if you're looking for a reliable yoga mat to help you on your journey, the Everyday Yoga Mat is definitely worth a try.

### [Stylish and Comfortable Paisley Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-paisley-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-paisley-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Gaiam Paisley Yoga Mat, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my home yoga practice. This mat not only provides the perfect cushioning to protect my joints but also ensures proper alignment, allowing me to maintain poses more comfortably. Plus, it's environmentally friendly, made without those harmful phthalates. However, there's a small issue: it can be quite slippery at first, especially when I sweat during intense sessions.

The Gaiam Paisley Yoga Mat is perfect for both beginners and seasoned yogis. Its reversible option offers different color schemes, catering to individual tastes, and the thickness is just right for sensitive joints. It's lightweight, easy to carry, and even has a slightly sticky surface that grips the floor well, preventing unwanted mat movements during practice.

However, the initial grip quality may leave some users disappointed as it can become quite slippery, especially when sweat accumulates. Fortunately, it is easy to clean with a damp cloth, helping maintain its fresh and clean appearance.

In conclusion, the Gaiam Paisley Yoga Mat is an attractive, comfortable, and well-made option for those looking to enhance their home yoga practice. With proper care and a few uses to break in the grip, you'll find yourself enjoying a more secure and cushioned workout.

### [5mm Printed Yoga Mat with Grip and Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="prosource-5mm-thick-yoga-mat-feather-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/prosource-5mm-thick-yoga-mat-feather-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the ProSource 5mm Feather Yoga Mat for a few months now and I can't get enough of it. Its exclusive design adds a touch of aesthetics to my yoga practice while the 5mm thickness offers just the right amount of cushioning for my joints. The mat's non-slip surface has been a game-changer during those tricky downward-facing dog and warrior poses, giving me incredible grip quality.

Its light-track feature ensures that the design doesn't fade even after extended use. Plus, with its moisture-resistant coating, odors are kept at bay and maintenance is a breeze. As an added bonus, this eco-friendly PVC mat doesn't harm the environment or your health.

One minor issue I've encountered is that sometimes there's slight slipping during certain poses, but overall, this yoga mat has greatly improved my balance and stability. It's also travel-friendly, weighing less than three pounds and rolling up easily for storage or transport.

In conclusion, the ProSource Feather Yoga Mat is perfect for both beginners and advanced yogis alike, offering durability, attractive design, and excellent grip quality. Whether you're hitting the studio or practicing from home, this mat is a must-have for all your yoga needs.

### [Extra Large 5mm Thick Yoga Mat with 70 Yoga Poses](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img alt="newme-fitness-yoga-mat-for-women-and-men-large-5mm-thick-68-inch-long-non-slip-exercise-mats-w-70-pr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/newme-fitness-yoga-mat-for-women-and-men-large-5mm-thick-68-inch-long-non-slip-exercise-mats-w-70-pr-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast, I've been using the NewMe Fitness Yoga Mat for quite some time now. The first thing that caught my eye is its size - it's large and thick which provides ample support during long workout sessions or yoga classes. The surface is sticky, non slip, and it doesn't absorb odors like some cheaper mats do. I particularly like how it maintains its shape even after extensive use.

However, there's one issue. As soon as you start breaking a sweat, the grip quality decreases significantly. I had to improvise and put a towel on top to prevent myself from slipping. For someone who's prone to accidents, this could be quite alarming.

All in all, the NewMe Fitness Yoga Mat earns points for its sturdiness and comfort, but loses some for its lackluster grip performance when it gets wet.

## Buyer's Guide

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/5mm-yoga-mats"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5mm+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="5mm Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

### Important Features to Consider

Yoga mats come in various sizes and thicknesses, with the 5mm being a standard option. When choosing a 5mm yoga mat, consider these important features:

- Thickness: A 5mm (approximately 0.2 inches) mat provides a good balance between cushioning and stability. It's thick enough to provide some padding for joints but thin enough to maintain a connection to the ground. If you need more or less cushioning, consider mats with different thicknesses.

- Material: The material of your yoga mat can affect its grip, comfort, and eco-friendliness. Common materials include PVC, TPE, and natural rubber. Look for a material that suits your needs and preferences.

- Grip: A good yoga mat should provide enough grip to prevent slipping during practice. Some mats have textured surfaces or special coatings to enhance grip, while others may require some breaking in.

- Size: Make sure the mat is large enough for your practice, especially if you do poses that require extra space. Standard sizes are 68" x 24" or 72" x 24", but some mats are available in wider or longer options.

### Considerations Before Purchasing

Before buying a 5mm yoga mat, consider the following:

- Your yoga practice: Think about the types of yoga you do and what features would be most beneficial for your practice, such as extra cushioning or a textured surface.

- Your budget: The price of a yoga mat can vary depending on the brand, material, and features. Determine how much you're willing to spend on a mat and prioritize the features that are most important to you.

- Brand reputation and customer reviews: Research the brand and read reviews from other yoga practitioners to get an idea of the quality and performance of the mat.

- Maintenance: Some mats require special care, such as hand washing or avoiding prolonged exposure to sunlight. Be sure to follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to prolong the life of your mat.

### General Advice for Yoga Mats

No matter which type of yoga mat you choose, keep these tips in mind:

- Test it out: Before making a purchase, try out the mat in a store or borrow one from a friend to see how it feels during your practice.

- Take care of your mat: Wipe your mat down after each use to remove sweat and dirt, and follow the manufacturer's care instructions to keep it in good condition.

- Invest in a carry case or strap: This will make it easier to transport your mat to and from the yoga studio or gym.
