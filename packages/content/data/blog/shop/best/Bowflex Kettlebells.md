The PowerBlock Adjustable Heavy Kettlebell is a remarkable piece of workout equipment. Its durability, adjustable weights, and thoughtful design make it a solid investment for any fitness enthusiast eager to enhance their home gym.

I recently added the Apex, Adjustable Kettlebell to my home gym routine and I must say, it's a game-changer. This versatile piece of equipment is a complete weight set that's perfect for muscle building and weight lifting.

One thing I love about this kettlebell is its adjustability. The weight can be customized between 20 and 50 pounds by replacing the removable spacer disks with standard 2.5, 5, or 10-pound weights (sold separately). This feature makes it easy for me to challenge myself as my fitness level improves, without needing to buy multiple kettlebells.

The build quality of the Apex Kettlebell is impressive too. It's made from solid cast-iron and reinforced with a powder coating, making it incredibly durable. I've been using this kettlebell regularly for months now and there's no signs of wear or damage whatsoever.

The traditional u-bar handle is another standout feature. It provides optimal grip control, allowing me to perform large movements with ease and precision. This has been especially helpful during tough workouts when I need maximum control over the weight.

In terms of exercise versatility, the Apex Adjustable Kettlebell truly shines. [Whether you're lifting, swinging, toning, or building muscle, this kettlebell delivers an effective workout.](https://best.serp.co/shop/kettlebell-weight/) I've found it particularly useful for circuit training and bodybuilding routines.

However, one drawback is that the weighted [plates](https://best.serp.co/shop/plates/) are not included, which means you'll need to purchase them separately. Additionally, although the product description does not mention any required tools, some reviewers have noted that a locking mechanism could make assembling and disassembling the kettlebell easier.

Overall, the Apex, Adjustable Kettlebell has been a valuable addition to my home gym. Its adjustability, robust build quality, and versatile exercise options have made my workouts more challenging and enjoyable. If you're looking for a high-quality kettlebell that offers flexibility and durability, this one is definitely worth considering.

The handle is ergonomic, making it comfortable to grip even during the most intense workouts. And the weight is distributed evenly, ensuring smooth movements no matter what exercise you're doing.

I must admit, there is one minor drawback. Due to the adjustable weights inside, it has a wider bottom half. This can limit your range of motion for some exercises, but a quick step or box can help you get around this.

Overall, the Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell has been an absolute pleasure to use. It's versatile, easy to adjust, and well-made. Plus, the free JRNY Mobile-Only Membership that comes with it offers trainer-led workouts and other cool features to keep your workouts fresh and exciting.

One of the significant benefits of this product is its space efficiency. It's a dream come true for anyone who wants an entire gym's worth of dumbbelling in the corner of their room. Furthermore, the durable molding around the metal plates ensures a smooth lift-off and quieter workouts.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the size of these weights can feel bulkier when using them, especially at higher weight settings. Secondly, the price point is relatively high compared to standard dumbbells. Lastly, the grips have a squared shape with knurling on the top and bottom, which may cause discomfort during extended use or at heavier weights.
