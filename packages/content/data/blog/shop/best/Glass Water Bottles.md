I recently incorporated the Bink Day Bottle into my daily routine, and I must say, it's been a game-changer! This simple, sleek glass water bottle with hydration tracking has not only made staying hydrated a breeze but also added a touch of color to my day. The dishwasher-safe aspect is a huge plus for me, as I loathe handwashing anything.

Plus, the free-from BPA, lead, cadmium, and phthalate construction gives me peace of mind, knowing that my drinking water is free from harmful chemicals.

However, there is a slight downside. The bottle can be a bit heavy and cumbersome, especially for those who prefer lighter or smaller water bottles. Additionally, it doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, which can be inconvenient during long drives.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Bink Day Bottle to anyone looking to improve their daily water intake while adding a pop of color to their life. It's a stylish and practical addition to any daily routine.
