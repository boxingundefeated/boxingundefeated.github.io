### [All-Purpose Non-Slip Yoga Mat for Comfort and Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats"><img alt="balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-extra-thick-yoga-mat-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-extra-thick-yoga-mat-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I've tried multiple mats in search of the perfect blend of comfort and support. The BalanceFrom GoYoga All-Purpose Extra Thick Yoga Mat has won me over with its 1/2 inch thickness and premium quality. This extra cushioning has made a significant difference, particularly during my practice on hard floors.

The double-sided non-slip surfaces offer excellent grip, giving me peace of mind while performing intense poses or when things get a little sweaty. It's also a breeze to clean, thanks to the moisture-resistant technology, which allows me to wash it with soap and water easily.

One feature that stands out is the easy-to-use strapping system, making transport and storage hassle-free. The strap ensures that I can carry it anywhere without causing strain, even during long commutes to my yoga studio.

However, there is room for improvement - the strap could be made longer, allowing it to be slung across my shoulder more comfortably. Additionally, some users have reported that the thickness may not be consistent throughout the entire mat.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the BalanceFrom GoYoga All-Purpose Extra Thick Yoga Mat. Its comfort, support, grip, and portability make it an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their yoga practice.

### [Stylish Mandala Print Yoga Mat: ProSource](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats)

I recently picked up the ProSource Printed Yoga Mat, and I must say it's been a game-changer in my yoga practice. The unique mandala design not only looks stunning but also adds a calming touch that helps me focus on my poses. The 5mm thickness provides just the right amount of cushioning to support my joints without making me feel unstable during more complex poses.

One thing I particularly love about it is the excellent grip it offers. The non-slip surface works wonders in helping me maintain balance and control, especially during tricky poses like downward-facing dog or warrior poses. But that's not all; the mat also boasts a moisture-resistant coating that keeps odors at bay and makes cleaning a breeze.

Another highlight for me is the portability of this mat. Weighing less than three pounds, taking it to and from my yoga class has never been easier. Plus, it rolls up neatly for convenient storage at home.

Although this is my first foray into yoga mats, I can already spot some areas where there's room for improvement. For instance, while the design is beautiful, some users have mentioned that the colors may differ slightly from the images online. Additionally, some reviewers have reported issues with tear and wear, although this hasn't been an issue for me so far.

In a nutshell, if you're starting out with yoga or looking to upgrade your mat, the ProSource Printed Yoga Mat Mandala is definitely worth considering. Its comfort, grip, and portability make it a top choice for both beginners and experienced yogis alike.

One aspect I particularly appreciated was its eco-friendly nature. The PVC material used is non-toxic and doesn't pose any harm to the environment, which is always a plus point in my book. Moreover, the moisture-resistant coating not only prevents odor but also makes it incredibly easy to maintain.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The initial smell can be a bit overwhelming, but thankfully, it dissipates with time. Additionally, while it's easy to carry around, it could use some extra padding to provide optimal support for travel purposes.

### [Gaiam Essentials 72" Yoga Mat with Carry Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats"><img alt="gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-carrier-strap-grey-72l-x-24w-x--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-carrier-strap-grey-72l-x-24w-x--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my workout routine. The first thing that caught my attention was the 10mm thick foam. This extra cushioning provides incredible support, especially during intense exercises like ab workouts and stretching. I've noticed a significant reduction in stress on my joints.

The non-slip ridges on the mat are another standout feature. They provide excellent traction, keeping me securely in place even during sweaty sessions. It's an assurance that one small slip won't lead to a embarrassing tumble mid-exercise!

But it's not all sunshine and roses. While the mat is super comfortable, it tends to stretch when weight is unevenly distributed, which can throw off my balance during certain poses. Additionally, it has a tendency to squeak on damp surfaces, making it a little distracting during yoga flows.

Portability is another area where this mat shines. The nylon carry strap included is incredibly convenient. It's easy to wrap around the rolled-up mat and sling it over my shoulder, making trips to and from the gym a breeze.

[Overall, I'd recommend the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat to anyone looking for added comfort and support during their yoga or Pilates sessions.](https://best.serp.co/shop/gaiam-yoga-mats/) Its extra thick foam, superior traction, and easy portability make it a valuable addition to any fitness routine. However, be prepared for some potential drawbacks, including stretching and squeaking.

### [Microdry All-Purpose Fitness Exercise Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/budget-yoga-mats"><img alt="microdry-deluxe-all-purpose-fitness-exercise-mat-with-high-impact-foam-72x26-inch-blue-size-72-x-27" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/microdry-deluxe-all-purpose-fitness-exercise-mat-with-high-impact-foam-72x26-inch-blue-size-72-x-27/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'd like to start by talking about how this fitness mat has revolutionized my workout routine. The Microdry Deluxe All Purpose Fitness Exercise Mat is truly a game-changer. I've been using it for a variety of workout sessions, from yoga to pilates, and the comfort it provides is unmatched.

The mat's 3 layered design offers excellent support, while its water-resistant surface ensures easy cleanup. The non-skid feature is an added bonus; I've never had to worry about sliding during my workout.

However, there's one issue that I need to address. The carry strap provided with the mat is quite flimsy and doesn't provide much support. It's my hope that future updates will include a stronger, more durable strap.

In conclusion, the Microdry Deluxe All Purpose Fitness Exercise Mat is a brilliant addition to any fitness enthusiast's toolkit. The comfort it provides is outstanding, and its versatility makes it perfect for a variety of exercises. Despite the minor inconvenience of the carry strap, it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the mat.
