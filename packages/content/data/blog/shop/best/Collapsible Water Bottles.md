### [Collapsible Design Silicone Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/collapsible-water-bottles)

After using this Iscream Collapsible Water Bottle for a few months, I've come to appreciate its functionality and convenience. The vibrant confetti design adds a nice touch to my everyday life. One of the things Iâ€™ve noticed is that this bottle is great for sports and keeping hydrated on the go. I often use it for trips to the gym, hiking, and even at my office job. The collapsible design makes it easy to stow away or carry around when filled up, preventing any spills or annoyances when I want to pack light.

What stood out to me the most are the bottle's carabiner and dishwasher-safe aspects. The carabiner attachment makes it super easy to clip onto my backpack or gym bag, ensuring that I always have access to water when I need it. And since it's dishwasher safe, I can easily keep it clean between uses without having to spend extra time scrubbing it by hand. Additionally, the double-walled design ensures that my drinks stay at the right temperature for longer periods of time.

However, there are a few cons that Iâ€™ve encountered with this water bottle. Firstly, itâ€™s a bit difficult to clean the inside thoroughly since it collapses. While it's dishwasher safe, some food particles can get trapped in the corners and are difficult to reach. Also, the screw on top isn't the tightest, making it occasionally leak when shaken or knocked around in my bag.

All in all, I would recommend the Iscream Collapsible Water Bottle for anyone who wants a fun, practical, and reusable way to stay hydrated while on the go.

### [Collapsible Water Bottle with Spiral Design- Sunbeam Orange](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/collapsible-water-bottles)

I've been using the Que Bottle for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's really changed the game for me when it comes to water bottles. It's not just about its sleek, fancy design that makes it stand out in my bag, but also the functionality that it offers while maintaining that fashionable charm.

The highlight for me would be its collapsible feature, which allows me to compress the bottle down to half its size. This way, I can easily slip it into tight spaces or pack it away while traveling without having to worry about adding extra bulk to my bag. That's a huge plus for someone like me who loves hiking or spending time outdoors but doesn't always have the space to carry a full-sized bottle.

On the flip side though, while I appreciate the eco-friendly approach of using food-grade silicone for the bottle and having it be entirely free of plastic, there's a small part of me that misses the sturdiness that comes with a hard plastic bottle. But, hey, that's just me trying to pick at clouds, I guess. Overall, the Que Bottle has definitely earned itself a permanent spot in my daily routine.
