I recently got my hands on the Tervis Despicable Me Minions The Rise of Gru Endless Summer Triple Walled [Insulated Tumbler](https://best.serp.co/shop/insulated-tumbler/) Travel Cup, and I must say, it has been a game-changer in keeping my drinks cold while I'm on the go. The triple insulation is no joke - it truly does keep my beverages chilled for up to 24 hours, making it perfect for those long, hot days at the beach.

One of the main reasons why I love this tumbler is its stainless steel construction. It not only feels sturdy and well-made but also prevents any unwanted tastes or odors from lingering around. Plus, it's super easy to clean, which is a huge plus in my book.

However, one thing that could use some improvement is the lid. While it is leak-resistant and easy to close, I do feel like it could be a bit more secure, especially when I'm carrying it in my bag.

All in all, the Tervis Endless Summer Minions Tumbler has quickly become an essential part of my daily life. Its sleek design and exceptional insulation make it perfect for anyone who loves spending time outdoors or just wants to enjoy a cold drink wherever they go.

### [Minion Aluminum Water Bottle (13.5 oz)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/minion-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/minion-water-bottles"><img alt="minion-despicable-me-universal-studios-water-bottle-aluminum-13-5-oz-blue-new-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/minion-despicable-me-universal-studios-water-bottle-aluminum-13-5-oz-blue-new-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a avid fan of Despicable Me, I couldn't resist grabbing this Minion-themed water bottle from Universal Studios. I've been using it every day for both my morning workout and office hours. One of the first things to strike me about this bottle was how robustly built it is. The blue aluminum body and sturdy black lid ensure that my water stays cold and safe from spills. Not to mention, the Minions embossed on the bottle add a fun touch and never fail to bring a smile to my face throughout the day.

One downside, however, is its 13.5 oz capacity. While this size is perfect for short trips, I find myself needing to refill it more often than I usually do with my bigger water bottle. Despite this, the Minion water bottle from Universal Studios has become a constant companion in my daily routine. Its cute design and excellent build quality make it a worthwhile addition to your Minion collection or as a perfect gift for fellow fans.

One feature that stands out is how well this tumbler fits in my car's cup holders. It's convenient for long drives, especially with the silicone-sealed lid that helps prevent splashes during bumpy rides. Also, the double-walled construction keeps condensation at bay, so I don't have to worry about any messy spills while enjoying a cold drink.

The straw included is particularly tough – no worries about it getting bent or damaged from constant chewing. Plus, the stopper feature ensures it stays put and doesn't get lost.

However, there are a few downsides. It's not suitable for microwaving, which can be a drawback for some users who might want to heat up their beverages. Additionally, even though it's dishwasher safe, I'd recommend hand washing to keep the intricate design in tip-top shape.

All in all, I'd highly recommend the Zak Designs Despicable Me 3 Tumbler for anyone who loves the Minion bunch and wants a durable, functional, and visually appealing travel companion.
