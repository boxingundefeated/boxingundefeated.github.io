### [Durable 16 oz Ello Dash Water Bottle with Soft Spout](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles"><img alt="ello-dash-bpa-free-plastic-water-bottle-grey-16-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-dash-bpa-free-plastic-water-bottle-grey-16-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Ello Dash Water Bottle, and let me tell you, this little gem has been a game-changer for me. As a mom always on-the-go, I needed a reliable water bottle that could keep up with my busy lifestyle, and this one definitely delivers.

First off, the design is absolutely adorable. The 16 oz. size is perfect for keeping me hydrated throughout the day, and the silicone sleeve not only adds an extra layer of protection for when it gets dropped (and let's be real, it happens), but it also gives the bottle an extra touch of style.

One of the standout features of this bottle is the locking one-touch flip lid. It's super easy to use, even for my toddler, and it's made with a silicone soft spout that keeps everything clean and prevents spills. I can't tell you how many times I've avoided the dreaded wet bag because of this little feature.

However, like any product, the Ello Dash isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with leakiness, but in my personal experience, I haven't had any problems with that. I also appreciate that it's dishwasher safe, making it super easy to clean and maintain.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Ello Dash Water Bottle to anyone looking for a reliable, stylish, and easy-to-use water bottle. It's perfect for keeping kids and adults alike hydrated on-the-go, and it's definitely worth the investment.

### [Ello Campy 16 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles"><img alt="ello-campy-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-slider-lid-16-ounce-avalon-sea-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-campy-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-slider-lid-16-ounce-avalon-sea-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Ello Campy Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Slider Lid, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. This stylish bottle is not only eye-catching but also functions as a reliable companion for both indoor and outdoor use.

One of the features that impresses me the most about this bottle is its vacuum insulation. It performs exceptionally well at keeping beverages hot for up to six hours, making it perfect for those chilly winter days when all I crave is a steaming cup of coffee. On the other hand, cold drinks like smoothies also maintain their chill within this bottle, making it a go-to choice in the warmer months.

The bottle's soft-touch cork handle adds a touch of comfort and convenience, letting me carry it around with ease. Another feature worth mentioning is its leak-proof sealing slider lid, which ensures that my belongings remain dry even when the bottle is accidentally knocked over.

In terms of maintenance, the bottle is relatively low-maintenance as long as you follow the cleaning instructions. The lid is dishwasher safe, but due to the vacuum seal, hand-washing the bottle itself is recommended.

On the flip side, a minor inconvenience that I've encountered is the difficulty some individuals might face in cleaning the intricate parts of the lid, especially using a wire spoolie. Additionally, some users have reported issues with the stainless steel material flaking off over time, which may be a concern for those seeking a long-lasting solution.

Despite these minor setbacks, I believe that the Ello Campy Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Slider Lid has genuinely improved my overall experience with keeping my beverages hot and cold on the go. If you're in search of a stylish bottle that delivers on performance and convenience, this might just be the perfect choice for you.

### [Ello Hydra 64oz Stainless Steel Jug - Mauve](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles"><img alt="ello-64oz-hydra-stainless-steel-1-2-gallon-jug-mauve-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-64oz-hydra-stainless-steel-1-2-gallon-jug-mauve-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Ello 64oz Hydra Stainless Steel [Water Jug](https://best.serp.co/shop/water-jug/) in a lovely shade of Mauve. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and here's my honest review.

First off, the size is perfect. This half-gallon jug is perfect for someone like me who's trying to stay hydrated throughout the day. I fill it up every morning and carry it around as my daily water supply. The vacuum insulation keeps my water cold all day, even when I leave it in the car on a hot sunny day.

The Ello Hydra also has some clever design features. I love the flip lid with its fully-covered silicone straw. No more messy spills or leaks! Plus, the straw makes drinking water feel incredibly convenient, especially when I'm on the go.

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Cleaning this jug is a bit tricky. The wide opening definitely helps, but I still find myself struggling to get rid of mold from the straw and mouthpiece. I wish the straw was easier to clean thoroughly.

Another minor issue is the weight. When the jug is filled to capacity, it can be quite heavy to carry around. But that's a small price to pay for staying hydrated!

Overall, I'm really happy with my Ello Hydra Water Jug. It's helped me increase my water intake, and its smart design features make it a joy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a substantial water bottle to keep them hydrated all day.

### [Ello Kella BPA-Free Glass Sipper with Straw](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles"><img alt="ello-kella-bpa-free-glass-sipper-with-straw-20oz-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-kella-bpa-free-glass-sipper-with-straw-20oz-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Ello Kella Glass Sipper has been a game-changer for me. As someone who enjoys a refreshing water or smoothie on the go, I needed a bottle that was stylish, eco-friendly, and easy to use. The Kella exceeded my expectations. Its made-over mason jar look is perfect for both casual and formal occasions. Despite being glass, it's sturdy and lightweight, making it easy to carry around.

The friction-fit lid with its real cork accent is not only visually appealing but also secures my beverages perfectly. Plus, its wide-mouth opening is great for adding [ice cubes](https://best.serp.co/shop/ice-cubes/), and it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. The silicone grip adds a nice touch of comfort.

One of the best things about this bottle is the absence of any unpleasant aftertaste, which is often a problem with plastic bottles. It's also reassuring to know that it's BPA-free and safe for use in the [microwave](https://best.serp.co/shop/microwaves/) and dishwasher.

However, there's one small issue - the bottle tag advises hand-washing the lid, which contradicts the product description stating that all parts are dishwasher safe. Regardless, this minor inconvenience doesn't outweigh the many benefits and convenience the Kella provides.

Overall, the Ello Kella Glass Sipper is a stylish and functional companion for daily use. It enhances the taste of my beverages while reducing my plastic consumption. Highly recommended!

### [Ello 32-Ounce Pogo Chug Tritan Plastic Water Bottle - Aquaviva & Pink Satin](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles"><img alt="ello-32-ounce-pogo-chug-tritan-plastic-water-bottle-aquaviva-pink-satin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-32-ounce-pogo-chug-tritan-plastic-water-bottle-aquaviva-pink-satin-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Ello Pogo Chug Tritan Water Bottle in Aquaviva & Pink Satin for a while now, and it's been a game-changer in helping me stay hydrated throughout the day. The 32-ounce capacity is perfect for me, as I'm someone who drinks a lot of water. The sturdy Tritan construction ensures that this bottle is not only durable but also free from any unpleasant aftertaste.

One of the features I truly appreciate is the chug-style lid with its leak-proof cover. It allows me to hydrate quickly and efficiently without worrying about spills. Additionally, the soft-touch carry loop makes it incredibly easy to bring this bottle with me wherever I go.

However, I must admit that cleaning this bottle can be a bit challenging due to its wide-mouth design. While I love the lack of a straw for minimizing mold growth, the absence of any crevices where bacteria can hide would have made maintenance even more straightforward.

All things considered, I am extremely satisfied with the Ello Pogo Chug Tritan Water Bottle. Its leak-proof design, durable construction, and easy-to-carry functionality make it a must-have for those who prioritize hydration in their daily lives.
