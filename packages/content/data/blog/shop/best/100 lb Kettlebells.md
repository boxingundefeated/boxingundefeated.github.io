### [Gravity-Cast Powder Coated Kettlebell Weights for Men & Women](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="kettlebell-kings-5-90lb-powder-coated-kettlebell-weights-for-women-men-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kettlebell-kings-5-90lb-powder-coated-kettlebell-weights-for-women-men-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first laid my hands on the Kettlebell Kings Powder Coated Kettleweights, I knew I was in for a treat. The solid construction of these bells is evident from the moment you pick one up, with a sturdy handle that ensures a comfortable grip. I've been using them for a few months now, and they've become my go-to choice when it comes to home workouts.

The first thing that stands out about these kettlebells is the powder coating. It provides an excellent grip, making it easier to maintain control during intense workouts. I've found that with some other brands, the paint tends to wear off quickly, leaving a slippery surface that can lead to accidents. But not with these! The paint has held up well, even after some vigorous use.

Another feature I appreciate is the seamless casting. This means there are no sharp edges or weak spots on the kettlebell, making it safer and more comfortable to use. Plus, it gives the overall design a sleek and polished look that I absolutely love.

One minor issue I've encountered is the color-coding on the handles. While it's helpful to have kilogram and pound measurements, the colors used don't always match up perfectly with the weights. It can take a few seconds longer than expected to figure out which kettlebell you're using, especially if you're in the middle of a workout. But this is really just a minor inconvenience and doesn't significantly impact my overall enjoyment of the product.

Overall, I can't recommend the Kettlebell Kings Powder Coated Kettlebell Weights highly enough. They're well-made, comfortable to use, and provide a reliable and effective workout experience. If you're in the market for some new kettlebells, these are definitely worth considering.

### [Body-Solid 100 lb. Kettlebell with Matte Black Finish](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-50-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-50-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a big fan of Body-Solid's Kettlebells ever since I started incorporating them into my workout routine. The KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells are a staple in my home gym, and they've been a game-changer for my strength training and overall fitness.

First off, the matte-black chip-resistant powder coat finish is a standout feature. It not only looks sleek and modern but also provides an excellent grip even when my hands are sweaty during intense workout sessions. Plus, the powder coat is incredibly durable and resists chipping, which keeps the kettlebells looking brand new for much longer than other brands I've tried.

Another highlight is the easy-to-read weight display on each kettlebell. Having the weight clearly marked makes it simple and quick to find the right size for my needs, whether I'm doing kettlebell swings or incorporating them into other exercises.

Finally, the machined bottoms on these kettlebells provide a stable, wobble-free base. This is super important for balance and safety, especially during exercises like kettlebell snatches and lunges.

However, one downside is that the range of weights available is somewhat limited. While they do offer kettlebells from 5 to 80 pounds, I wish there was an option for a 90 or 100-pound kettlebell to continue challenging myself as I progress in my fitness journey.

All in all, the Body-Solid KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells have been a fantastic addition to my home gym. They're durable, versatile, and offer a comfortable grip for a safe and effective workout experience.

### [100 lb French Fitness Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="french-fitness-cast-iron-kettlebell-100-lbs-new-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/french-fitness-cast-iron-kettlebell-100-lbs-new-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this French Fitness Cast Iron Kettlebell for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has become my go-to workout companion. The 100 lbs weight provides a perfect blend of challenge and comfort that keeps me motivated every day. [The kettlebell design is excellent, offering great stability while ensuring a smooth, ergonomic grip for all my exercises.](https://best.serp.co/shop/onnit-kettlebells/) [Whether it's cardio workout or strength training, this kettlebell has become an essential part of my fitness routine.](https://best.serp.co/shop/kettlebell-weight/)

One of the best features of this kettlebell is its construction. The cast iron is robust and resilient, which means it won't chip or crack even with consistent, heavy use. The paint job is also durable, keeping the kettlebell looking brand new no matter how much I've been swinging it around!

However, there is one thing that could be improved. This kettlebell, being 100 lbs, might be too heavy for beginners. It would have been great if there was a range of weights available, like 20 lbs or 30 lbs, to cater to a broader audience. Nonetheless, for those who are ready to take their fitness game to the next level, this 100 lbs kettlebell definitely delivers.

So guys, if you're looking for a solid, high-quality kettlebell that can help you build strength, stamina, and agility, then the French Fitness Cast Iron Kettlebell is the perfect choice for you. It's not just a piece of workout equipment; it's a tool that can help you transform your body and take your fitness journey to new heights.

### [100 lb. Commercial Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="power-systems-22818-kettlebell-prime-100-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/power-systems-22818-kettlebell-prime-100-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With 15 weights available, ranging from 10 to 100 lbs, this kettlebell has allowed me to diversify my workouts and target different muscle groups, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness classes and facilities.

The solid cast iron construction ensures durability and stability during even my most intense workout sessions. Each weight is distinctively marked with a colored band on the handle and a tooled weight on each side, making it easy to identify which weight I'm using at a glance.

The matte black powder coat finish not only provides a smooth and finished texture for enhanced grip but also holds chalk well and feels comfortable in my hand. The slight texturing of the finish prevents the kettlebell from slipping during swings or other dynamic movements.

The only minor issue I've encountered is that the handle and kettlebell size increase with the weight of each bell, which might take some adjustment if you're used to a certain size or shape. Overall, the Power Systems 22818 Kettlebell Prime has proven to be an excellent addition to my workout gear, helping me achieve my fitness goals and enabling me to vary my workouts for a thorough and effective workout experience.

### [Classic Style Troy VTX 100 lb Cast Iron Kettlebell for Strength and Endurance](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="troy-vtx-cast-iron-kettlebells-100-lb-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/troy-vtx-cast-iron-kettlebells-100-lb-single-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The durability is also top-notch, as the black cast iron has held up perfectly in my intense workout sessions, showing no signs of wear or damage.

### [Vinyl Coated Kettlebells with Special Protective Bottom](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

I recently decided to give Bintiva Kettlebells a try, and boy am I glad I did! These professional-grade, vinyl-coated kettlebells are perfect for anyone looking to enhance their fitness routine. The special protective bottom ensures stability and safety while you work out, and the weights are color-coded by weight so you can easily distinguish them during a workout session.

One feature I really appreciate is the uncoated handle. It's smooth and doesn't stick to my hands like some other brands I've tried. This makes it much more comfortable and easier to use during my workouts, which is a big plus in my book!

However, it's worth mentioning that some users have reported issues with the bottom coming off. While I haven't personally experienced this problem, it's something to keep in mind when considering purchasing these kettlebells.

The unique design of this kettlebell, featuring a detailed Sasquatch face, not only adds a fun twist to my exercise regimen but also inspires me to push harder and break through my fitness plateaus.

One aspect that really stands out about the Bigfoot kettlebell is its sturdiness. The solid cast iron construction makes it feel incredibly secure and reliable during even my most intense workout sessions. It's evident that Onnit took great care in crafting this piece, as evidenced by the even weight distribution and comfortable grip.

Another highlight of this product is its excellent durability. Despite using it multiple times a week for several weeks now, the paint hasn't chipped or worn off in any significant way – a testament to the high-quality materials and manufacturing process employed by Onnit.

However, one minor issue I've encountered with the Bigfoot kettlebell is the way its ears stick out.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Onnit Primal Bell (Bigfoot - 90lb) to anyone looking to add a little excitement and motivation to their fitness routine.

Another standout feature was the steel-reinforced handles. They provide not only durability but also a comfortable grip which is especially important when you're swinging this thing around! Plus, it comes with a 2-year guarantee which gives me peace of mind about its longevity.

However, one downside is its size. Even though I expected it to be large due to its 100lb weight, lifting and storing it can be quite challenging. But hey, no pain, no gain, right?

All in all, the Body-Solid 100lb Cast Iron Kettlebell has been a game-changer in my home workout routine. It's durable, easy to grip, and has an attractive design.

### [Yes4all 100 lb Powder Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/100-lb-kettlebells"><img alt="yes4all-powder-coated-cast-iron-competition-kettlebell-32-kg-71-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yes4all-powder-coated-cast-iron-competition-kettlebell-32-kg-71-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sure, I'd love to review the Yes4all Powder Coated Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell, 32 kg, 71 lb. I've been using this kettlebell in my gym routines and I must say, it's a game-changer!

Firstly, the powder-coated finish is a game-changer. It's not just about the rust and corrosion resistance it provides, but also the grip strength it enhances. During my intense workout sessions, I was sweating profusely, but I never had to worry about the kettlebell slipping out of my hands.

The slightly textured handle was another standout feature for me. It provides a secure grip, allowing me to swing the kettlebell with confidence. I used to dread the squat-swing-swing-swing exercise, but now I enjoy it, all thanks to this kettlebell.

The weight accuracy is another highlight. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the kettlebell was accurate to within 2% of the stated weight. This level of precision is important, especially when you're using it for competition purposes.

However, there are a few cons that need to be addressed. Firstly, the kettlebell is a bit heavy, especially for beginners. It took me a few sessions to get used to the 32 kg weight. Secondly, the packaging could be improved. The kettlebell was loosely packed in a box, and I was a bit worried it might get damaged during transit.

In conclusion, the Yes4all Powder Coated Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell is a reliable and durable workout companion. It's perfect for anyone looking to enhance their strength training routines. However, beginners might find the weight too heavy, and the packaging could be improved to ensure the product's safety during transit.

One thing that I absolutely love about these kettlebells is the matte-black chip-resistant powder coat finish. It provides an amazing grip even when my hands are all sweaty from a workout. Plus, it doesn't chip or scratch easily, keeping them looking sleek and new even after many intense sessions.

The easy-to-read weight display is also a big plus. No more guessing which kettlebell is which - just a quick glance and I know exactly which one to grab!

Another feature that I appreciate is the flat machined bottoms. They provide a completely stable base, eliminating any chances of wobbling during intense swings or lifts. This gives me peace of mind knowing that I can perform these high-impact movements safely.

However, one small issue I encountered with this kettlebell is that due to its size and weight, it can be a bit challenging to handle for beginners. So, if you're just starting out, you might want to consider starting with a lighter model.

All in all, the Body Solid Cast Powder Coated Kettlebells have made a significant difference in my fitness routine. They're durable, provide excellent grip, and ensure a stable workout environment. Definitely worth investing in if you're looking to upgrade your home gym!

The large flat base ensures the kettlebell is stable during rest periods and prevents any unwanted wobbling, which is perfect for storing them in my limited workout space.

However, there has been one aspect of these kettlebells that has been a bit of a letdown - the imperfections on the handle. Though these are minor, they can be a tad painful when gripping the kettlebell for longer workout sessions. Additionally, I found the surface to be slightly rough at times, making it feel like it needs to be smoother.
