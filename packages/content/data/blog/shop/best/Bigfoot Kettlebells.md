One of my favorite features is the gently curved handle with its textured surface. It makes gripping the kettlebell comfortable and secure, even when my hands are sweaty from an intense workout. Plus, the wide handle allows me to grip it with one hand or two, giving me more variety in my exercise routine.

It's like a piece of performance art in my home gym. Plus, the enlarged handles really enhance my grip strength, making me feel like a true beast during my workouts.

However, I did experience a couple of minor setbacks with this primal bell. The chip-resistant coating, while strong, can be a tad difficult to clean after an intense workout session. Also, the length of the bell can make cleans a bit awkward, though it's perfect for snatches.
