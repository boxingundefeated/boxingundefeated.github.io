### [S'well Galaxy Supernova 17oz Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles"><img alt="swell-17oz-galaxy-supernova-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-17oz-galaxy-supernova-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently came across the S'well 17oz Galaxy Supernova Water Bottle, and I must say, it has become my go-to for keeping my beverages hot or cold on the go. I love the sleek and stylish design, which not only looks great but also feels comfortable in my hand. The bottle's wide mouth allows me to easily add [ice cubes](https://best.serp.co/shop/ice-cubes/) or tea bags, making it incredibly versatile.

One of the things that stood out to me about this bottle is its excellent insulation. I've tried other insulated bottles in the past, but none of them keep my drinks as cold or hot for as long as the S'well does. I was genuinely surprised when my coffee remained steaming hot after hours in the bottle, and my water stayed ice-cold even after a long day in the sun.

The bottle's build quality is also quite impressive. The stainless steel construction feels sturdy and durable, while the vacuum seal lid keeps my liquid safely contained within the bottle, without any leaks or spills. Additionally, the bottle's reflective lustre finish gives it a unique and eye-catching appearance that has garnered numerous compliments from friends and coworkers.

However, there are a few downsides to this bottle worth mentioning. Firstly, the bottle is relatively heavy, especially when filled to the brim with liquid. This may not be a problem for everyone, but it's worth considering if you're looking for a lightweight option. Secondly, the bottle can be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly, as bacteria can build up in the cap and on the rim. To address this, I've found that using a toothpick or a straw brush to clean the cap helps ensure that it stays clean and hygienic.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the S'well 17oz Galaxy Supernova Water Bottle. It's a stylish and functional choice for anyone who wants to stay hydrated in style, and its excellent insulation capabilities make it a standout option in its category. I would highly recommend this bottle to anyone who is looking for a reliable and eco-friendly way to keep their beverages hot or cold on the go.

### [Sleek Onyx 40oz S'well Travel Mug for Hydration On-The-Go](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles"><img alt="swell-40-oz-onyx-stainless-steel-traveler-triple-layered-vacuum-insulated-bottle-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-40-oz-onyx-stainless-steel-traveler-triple-layered-vacuum-insulated-bottle-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid user of S'well's traveler, I have found it to be the perfect companion for my daily hydration needs. From long hikes in the mountains to intense workout sessions, this 40 oz bottle has never let me down. The wide-mouth opening makes it easy to fill with ice or pour [hot tea](https://best.serp.co/shop/hot-tea/), while the stainless steel cap ensures a leak-free experience.

However, there are a few cons to consider. Firstly, due to its large size, it doesn't fit into standard car cup holders, which can be inconvenient during long drives. Secondly, although the handle is quite comfortable to hold, it can be difficult to place the bottle upright without any support.

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the S'well 40 oz traveler. Its vacuum-insulated technology keeps my beverages at their optimal temperatures for hours on end, and its sleek design adds a touch of elegance to my daily routine. Highly recommended!

### [Blue Suede Original S'well Water Bottle (17 oz)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles"><img alt="swell-bottle-blue-suede-17-oz-stainless-steel-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-bottle-blue-suede-17-oz-stainless-steel-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The first thing that struck me about this bottle is its build. It's made of high-grade 18/8 stainless steel which is not only sturdy but also safe to use since it's BPA-free and toxic-free. The triple-layer insulation ensures that my beverages stay at their optimal temperature for hours, perfect for those long gym sessions or hot summer days.

One of the standout features for me was how easy it was to use. The screw cap isn't fiddly at all and the bottle fits comfortably in my hand. However, I did have to wash it quite frequently - bacteria can build up in the cap and on the rim if you don't clean it properly. But with some regular love, this bottle has been serving me well.

As for design, the Blue Suede colourway is right up my alley. It's subtle yet chic, making it not just a functional accessory but a fashion statement too. The only downside? It's quite heavy even when empty. But hey, that's the price you pay for superior insulation and durability!

The S'ip by S'well water bottle has quickly become a staple in my daily life. The bright colors and cute patterns make it easy for me to showcase my personal style while staying hydrated. Not only does it fit perfectly in most cup holders, but the silicone loop also provides a comfortable grip when I'm on the go.

One of the features that stood out to me is its ability to keep beverages hot or cold for long periods. Both the hot coffee and ice-cold water remained at their desired temperatures, even after hours in my bags. Additionally, the double-walled vacuum insulation prevents any condensation from forming on the exterior, making it a clean and convenient choice.

On the downside, the small opening can make thorough cleaning a bit challenging. However, this has not deterred me from using my S'ip by S'well water bottle daily.

In conclusion, the S'ip by S'well water bottle offers excellent insulation, a comfortable design, and is available in a variety of colors and patterns. While its cleaning process may require a little extra effort, I can confidently say that it is worth the investment for anyone looking to stay hydrated while keeping their beverages at their preferred temperature.

### [S'well 40-Oz. Onyx Roamer Bottle - Black](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles"><img alt="swell-40-oz-onyx-roamer-bottle-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-40-oz-onyx-roamer-bottle-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the S'well 40-Oz. Onyx Roamer Bottle for a while now and it's my go-to bottle for hikes, camping trips, and even those long days at the beach. The 40-ounce capacity means I can stay hydrated without having to refill constantly. I love how its sleek design fits comfortably in my hand, but the small carry handle at the top adds an extra level of convenience.

One of the things that impress me most about this bottle is its ability to keep my drinks either hot or cold for hours on end. The triple-layered, vacuum-insulated construction does a remarkable job of retaining temperature, whether I'm enjoying a hot cup of coffee or a refreshing iced tea. Plus, the condensation-free exterior ensures my hands stay dry no matter how cold the beverage inside is.

However, one issue I've encountered is the durability of the handle. It tends to break off after a few uses, which can make it difficult to carry the bottle. Fortunately, customer service has always been quick to send me a replacement, but I hope they can improve the strength and longevity of the handle in future designs.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the S'well 40-Oz. Onyx Roamer Bottle. Its thermal insulation is second to none, and its stylish design adds a touch of elegance to any outdoor adventure. The only drawback is the handle, but I'm willing to overlook that inconvenience given all the other great features this bottle has to offer.
